You think this a new phenomenon that started with Rodney King? \n\nNo, I think it's being going on since the inception of policing, I referenced Rodney King to show how similar all three incidents were.\n\n>Where have you been where these are described as isolated incidents? \n\nGenerally by white Boomers who believe the police are just a bunch of nice young men who help old ladies across the road all day long. They're just shocked that \"a police officer could do something like that\" lol.\n\n>I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019re older than 13. The naivety is too strong to be trolling.\n\nI'm really not sure what you misunderstood out of what I wrote, but you are so barking up the wrong tree. I'm well past my 20s, a former Marine, and saltier than the Dead Sea. I haven't heard anyone describe me as naive in the last 15 years lol, usually they use words like \"jaded\" and \"paranoid\""

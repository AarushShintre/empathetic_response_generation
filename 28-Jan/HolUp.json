      "body": "Obstruction of traffic. At least here in Texas. Each state is different though.\n\nOfficially, there are speed limit signs posted which is supposed to be what the max speed limit is. However in practice it's more nuanced than that.\n\nTexas lawbook states that an unreasonable speed is an offense, which leaves ambiguity to what unreasonable is. If everyone is going 90, and I'm going 60 it can be argued that I'm going the unreasonable speed as I'm basically creating an obstruction to the flow of traffic. Same can be said the other way around, if the speed limit is 70 and everyone is doing 50, but I'm doing 70, there's a chance I can be pulled over and given a ticket. It sounds dumb, and it is, but the laws are ambiguous and open to a lot of interpretation.\n\nThis is also the same reason why cops here can give tickets to people who go the speed limit in the left lane. It's expected to be the fast lane for passing, and if you're just camping and blocking the lane for passing you can get a ticket for that too."

The internet, which i consulted after multiple people told me i was wrong without saying how, also consistently states that it can be illegal to drive significantly slower than the fliw of traffic if, and only if, the flow of traffic is at or below the speed limit. \nIf you go at the speed limit in the left lane the issue isn't that you are at the speed limit, the problem is that you are in the left lane and not passing anyone. If there is a truck in the right lane going below the speed limit then passing that truck in the left lane at the speed limit is not illegal in any way im aware of. After passing him you should then switch back into the right lane."

In Oklahoma for example, they have a max and a min speed limit, iirc based on my personal travels.\n\nMileage may vary, laws are different, if you're curious about your own state I would suggest talking to someone familiar with your state laws. Reddit isn't confined to your own state or country, so best to not always assume what Reddit says is true for you. Just offering my 2 cents."

      "body": "You seem to try to be nonconfrontational so im sorry but all these people telling me im wrong and then not backing up their claims are annoying me. \nTexas lawbook does not say that unreasonably low speeds are illegal. It says that driving(among other things) in a way that obstructs the road is illegal. If you drive at the speed limit then other people behind you can drive at the speed limit which is the indended use of the road therefore you are not obstructing it. \nI have not been able to find a single article or law that states that following the flow of traffic could have priority over following the speed limit for texas or anywhere else. I have however easily found multiple articles cautioning that breaking the speed limit is breaking the law under any circumstances. The law is also quite clear on this although texas is actually a tiny bit more lenient here than other states. If you drive at or slightly below the speed limit under normal weather conditions(in adverse conditions you may be required to drive slower)  you are not breaking any laws. You might get pulled over if a cop thinks you are suspiciously cautious, which might indicate drunkenness but if his suspicion is unfounded there is nothing you could be charged with. \nMerging onto a highway is the only exception i can come up with as safety during the merge requires you to match the speed of traffic but afterwards you can slowly slow down to the speed limit if the slowest lane is faster than the speed limit."

Rather than being a bridge between Russia and the EU, it tilted 100% EU/NATO. As much as we both would like idealism & respect for sovereignty, we both know ground reality doesn't work like that. Before applying to NATO/EU Ukraine should've invested in their military, upto a certain amount that would've made a Russian attack very very costly or unsustainable. In this regard Ukraine's 'inaction' has consequences.\n\nCase in point look at Finland and Sweden. They are strongly armed, neutral & economically integrated with western economies. Only now that Russia is focused on Ukraine, did they decide joining NATO. All this was never the case with Ukraine to begin with.\n\nAlso War is never common people's fault.

After the reform, then first of all, reasonablity is no longer a cause of action. Secondly, the court would need a unanimous vote from a 15-judge panel (currently I don't think that full-coutt panels are ever used) to strike down a law. Third, even if the law is struck down, the Knesset  can reinstate it with 61 votes (which the ruling coalition has by default).

I have never seen it outside reddit though, so who knows.\n\n> The proposal regarding the Arab MKs has already been filed, for one example.\n\nAre you referring to the bill that would prohibit people that have voiced support for terrorists and terrorism from office? How is that different than banning Kach? And it isn't all Arab MK's. Don't make it about race. It bans individuals that support terrorism. I don't see how it would fail in court without any judicial reform as banning Kach passed muster. Especially if it is worded in a race neutral way that would apply to any hypothetical Jewish terrorists. Again, I'm not necessarily for it, but it isn't the death of democracy, and the debate about banning parties that incite violence ended 30 years ago.\n\n> As for the US, the US has protections which don't exist in Israel. Starting with the Constitution and a greater degree of separation of powers and continuing with a court system which is far more willing to strike down laws than the current Israeli one.\n\nThat's true, but missed my point. Everything is run by convention and the idea there is a rule of law. Should convention break down, and the people no longer support the institution of democracy, that's the end of it regardless. The Senate has nuclear option. Court packing is always a possibility. There was a civil war and reconstruction for fucks sake.\n\nAgain, you forget about principle one. The majority of Israelis are not going to tolerate the break down of democracy. Lead with real issues that could plausibly happen. The coalition can plausibly take steps to protect themselves in legal proceedings that aren't significant enough to disrupt society or compromise the general integrity of the government or drastically elevate the level of corruption we as a western society have come to expect of politicians. Talk about that. The second the Knesset acts in a way that would shock the conscience of enough of the electorate, coalition breaks and elections correct the overreach. Let me know when the proposal to suspend elections, dismiss the court, and ban non-likud parties hits the floor, and we'll see what happens. Maybe I'll owe you a coke."

The current law being passed applies to soldiers not following superior orders in the battlefield because there have been people disobeying orders and risking their crew, some soldiers mutinee because they don't feel well equipped (this one is rough and it often happens) but none of us so far has seen a single soldier saying \"I am on the frontline against my will\".

Both respective powers had men women and children armed in order to defend their cities and those irregulars fought like hell even if most ineffective.  \n\nTerror strikes do nothing to destroy the will of the people to fight.  One could make the case in total war all targets are valid and your trying to destroy the oppositions ability to fight, but in the modern day precision guided munitions to knock out factories, depot's, warehouses etc are much more effective than massive terror campaigns."

This is like an athlete getting more and more surgeries to keep competing at the top level and earning money that they can then spend when they're old to replace all their joints. \n\nThis is much worse (for the world) than not emitting sooner but probably less profitable for Norway.

Besides gas, oil is still and will continue to be important (possibly less so over the years) well into the future. Think about everything oil is used for, from medicines to electronics. An EV, although powered by electricity, is full of components made by products made from oil. \n\n3) If Norway shut down its oil and gas industry in the next few years, what good would that do? The gap would be filled by other countries, it is naive to think otherwise.

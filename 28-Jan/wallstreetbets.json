When it's like 80% of people saying that, i feel like it's gunna be big money taking advantage of it and it wont touch those numbers.\n\nBasically what i mean is the whole market is always fuck me fuck you fuck me fuck you and whichever side has the most conviction will be the side that gets fucked first.  Like the middle of this week seemed fine for a medium RSI roll upwards.  So of course, \"fuck you, 396. Get margin called, idiot.\"  Then it resumed its steady roll up through the 400-406s.  Everyone is saying 410 then pullback time.  So of course, \"fuck you, 402, get margin called.\" Is what my emotional trading strategy is telling me.  Or maybe people have too many OTM calls and once they start panick covering like crazy it will be a 397 day.  Or too many people could start to say \"nah the pullback is here right now\" and then market will be like \"oh is it? Fuck you, 416. Get margin called, idiot.\""

The thing to remember is that the market trades in channels. A big support for the SPY is 405 and below that 402.65 (this was the high of day a couple of days ago and it took the market many attempts to break through). If SPY breaks through those levels than the bulls may start selling down to 400. If the market tests those levels and gets rejected, it is very bullish and the crash will come later. Point is, wait for confirmation and then open up positions. To not get fucked by the market, cut your losses quickly. Don't hold onto losers hoping they will bounce back."

Much easier to lose 10% and bounce back than 50% where now you need to double up just to cover a loss.  I feel like gamblers here could save themselves a lot of pain if they kept this in mind.\n\nAnd I think I'll start considering the channels more often.  I kinda assumed it was all a lame attempt at fortune telling, but for a total market ETF it seems to be law, not speculation.  Individual stocks seem to just do whatever they want, but not the diversified funds"

Risk management and cutting losses is critical when it comes to trading.\n\nSupport/resistance levels are real and it's not fortune telling. For example, on Jan 17 SPY reached 400 but got rejected. The next day on the 18th, SPY retested the 400 resistance levels and got rejected again. The market plummeted to 391.5 afterward."

That would be a major major change in tact, so I think this probability is low.\n\nWhat this means in practice is that say the blackout period started today. PCE comes out tomorrow hot. the Fed fund futures market tilt more towards 50 points in anticipation of a signal. If one comes, the move will continue. If no signal goes out, then the move will reverse.\n\nThis is just how the Fed under JPOW operates.

All this bullshit about continued aggressive increases and holding for extended period of time has been out and out lies.\n\nI really hope you\u2019re wrong and they maintain the course and stay true to their words because I can see them easing up early and the inflation waves coming back with a vengeance at which point the fed will have lost the trust and faith of the citizens to do what the fuck they\u2019re designed to do.  \n\nSo it\u2019s like i said in the op, these mfrs are dropping the news purposely to drive the market to their will. That\u2019s fucking cute. Market manipulation by the fed\u2026.. I can\u2019t even say I\u2019m shocked."

A recession is fucking inevitable. All they\u2019re gonna do by easing early is FUCK up all the work they\u2019ve do to date and then HAVE TO MORE AGGRESSIVELY increase the rate further.

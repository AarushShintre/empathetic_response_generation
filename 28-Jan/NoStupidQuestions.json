It is well done as far as showing that animals are so much more like us, than we think. They have high intelligence (even if we don\u2019t see it because it may be expressed in different ways), they have all the complex emotions we have, they have individual personalities, they have complex lives and agendas, they love their children, take care of their ill, mourn their dead, feel joy, and anger, etc. He uses several experiments and observations to support this. Something I learned on my own, but wanted to hear the scientific take.     \n\nThe thing that surprised me is, he again and again states his confusion about how, with such clear evidence there is such resistance in both the scientific and laymen, that they are as they are. I keep yelling at him, \u201cPeople make up religion, deny human caused climate change, deny Covid, elections, that the earth goes round the sun, on and on, for \u201cjustification\u201c to do whatever they want. They lie to themselves that animals are mostly void functions of life SO THAT THEY CAN USE THEM GUILT FREE FOR ANYTHING THEY WANT.  In this case no trains hitting bison, and open land for their own farming and cattle.     \n\nWe torture them by the millions in lab and product testing. We destroy wetlands and forest for urban sprawl. We farm them for meat, or worse yet because we like their coats, even though we could stay warmer other ways. We pluck(ed) them from the wild to cage them as slaves for our entertainment. We deny them their own kind so they have no other choice but to express their need for love toward us as pets in some sick forced Stockholm Syndrome captivity. We breed them in ways that is unhealthy for them, because we like snubbed noses or downturned ears.     \n\nThe only way we can do all of this is to see them as something less than they are. Which of course plays well into believing we are some sort of divine image of God. We treat them like colonizers treat Native Americans or any other peoples. Manifest Destiny means \u201cGawd\u201d wants us to kill them and take their lands and disregard their value because he wants us to have everything because they are savages and we are something higher. No. No, we\u2019re not."

Shouldn't you feel the same way about *any* substance use that can ultimately lead to addiction?\n\nIt's foolish of anybody to definitively claim, \"I'll never get addicted\", because they simply can't predict that.\n\nBut there *are* plenty of people who buy and use cocaine every once in awhile during social occasions, without ever developing a dependence or otherwise having it impact their life outside of these occasions.\n\nAlcohol can be as much of a slippery slope as coke can be.

Just don't answer them then. \n\nBut I can think of a reason they *want* to ask the questions or perhaps even make them mandatory, and it has nothing to do with abortions, transgender issues or gender politics. It would have to do with *liability*.\n\nWomen athletes have higher rates of and more severe injuries on average compared to men. For example, ACL injuries are [6 times more common in women than men](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-gender-gap-in-sports-injuries-201512038708), which is a killer injury for a sports career at any level. This is due to a variety of factors, most of them rooted in biological truths that differentiate males from females. \n\nIrregular periods have been linked to bone injuries in female student athletes. CHOP (a children's hospital) states that [irregular periods are not okay](https://www.chop.edu/news/health-tip/connection-between-diet-periods-and-stress-fractures-female-athletes) and that it can be a sign of reduced bone mass or insufficient caloric intake for sports. \n\nNow let's say a female student athlete suffers an injury during competition. The parents sue alleging that the coach pushed her too hard, the facilities were subpar, the safety equipment failed or some other thing. If a school district has a record of the student disclosing irregular periods, they can have their expert sit in court and testify that irregular periods are associated with a greater incidence of sports injuries. \n\nI think that's the ultimate reason why the school district would want such records, to protect themselves from liability. In their minds, they are doing their due diligence. Sure, you can lie, but a lot of people see an official form and answer the questions.\n\nIt should be sufficient to merely educate the student athletes and let them know they should monitor their periods. Some girls see losing their period after competing in high level sports as a \"rite of passage,\" according to CHOP. Clearly there is a need to educate female athletes on this."

      "body": "Absolutely. Some of these are bad habits like drinking a lot of milk even though I know that when I have milk it makes me also want other bad foods like donuts, ice cream, cookies. It just makes me feel comfortable to have milk when I'm thirsty instead of water or coffee a lot of the time. I like to drink beer or liquor sometimes and I know that honestly it mostly just gives me almost instant hangovers and a queasy feeling through the next day.\n\nSome of the things are more addictive problems. I am a workaholic. I work at a library and the expectations of me are pretty low, but I'm constantly pushing myself to just go, go, go. Pull the most books, sort the most books, shelve the most books, be the fastest, do the most, prove myself. There is an indomitable and painful need to prove every day that I am valuable. It is just a holdover from a rough childhood and so I sort of know that in some form, this problem exists for me and it is part of my life to seek that proof of worth.\n\nSome things are just traits that I know are terrible that I secretly feel are just part of who I am, and so I am invested in not changing them. I'm terribly stubborn and will live with discomfort for years even if only to not have to change whatever decision I've made about something. I don't need to be right, I don't need to be happy, but I feel an incredibly strong attachment to getting to do whatever I've decided to do even against a lot of negative consequence because it is what I chose. I know this is also probably a holdover from childhood trauma, but being stubborn feels very much like a part of who I am and so I just try to be careful about locking a decision in when I know it will involve other people. In general that is true of these problems, I want ot make sure even if I've accepted these negative things, that I am doing what I can to make sure they aren't harming other people directly."

But saying that the second someone turns 18 they shouldn\u2019t date someone younger who is still in an appropriate age range is asinine. \n\nThere are two sets of twins. One set is boys the other set is girls. The boys were born in September. The girls were born in July the following year. They are in the same grade. In their junior year of high school when the boys are 17 and the girls are 16 one of the boys and one of the girls start dating. Over the summer they continue to date and hang out with each other and towards the end they start including their twins in their outings. The boys turn 18 that September and in October the other two twins start dating. \n\nBy your logic the boy and girl who started dating their junior year are perfectly fine continuing to date their senior year even though the boy turned 18. However for some reason it isn\u2019t okay that the other boy twin asked out the other girl twin because he was 18. \n\nPlease explain the difference. Both boys are exactly the same age and both girls are exactly the same age. The two boys have the same maturity level as each other and the two girls have the same maturity level as each other. So why is it okay for one 18 year old to date a 17 year old but it isn\u2019t okay for the other 18 year old to date the other 17 year old?\n\nI\u2019m seriously interested in trying to understand your reasoning."

Basically if you lack the confidence to do something, by saying to yourself...There's no way I can do that...you're preparing yourself for the failure you expect to experience, ie. You've predicted your failure, or self fulfilled a prophecy that you yourself made. It's not really a \"Prophecy\" as we understand it, because you knew you couldn't do it before even trying, which is most likely why you failed in the first place."

If both were to exist as a notion I was just going to see the thought process behind that as to how to balance the terms is all\n\n***Post Edit***\n\nProphetic, which is what your initial statement alluded too, is a bit different the umbrella that encompasses all that prophecy is. - to deny the existence of a prophet and one's ability to be prophetic, for some, is not directly tied into the concept of prophecy as a whole."

Specifically, it's a prediction that is delivered by a prophet, who is usually, though not always, a person instilled with their prognostic powers by a divine being. Prophecy tends to carry more weight than an everyday prediction, forecast, or educated guess.*\n\n*Prophesy, on the other hand, is a verb that describes the action of making a prophetic prediction. As with the noun, a prophet most commonly prophesies under divine influence.*\n\n*Prophesize is to reveal or foretell (something, esp a future event) by or as if by divine inspiration.*\n\n*Being Prophetic has to do with the accuracy of being able to prophesize a prophecy.*\n\n*Self-fulfilling prophecy, is the process through which an originally false expectation leads to its own confirmation. In a self-fulfilling prophecy an individual's expectations about another person or entity eventually result in the other person or entity acting in ways that confirm the expectations.*\n\nA self-fulfilling prophecy is what you seen the results would be of that person's doings as caused by their actions. It is not them seeing. The outsider is the one making the prophecy."

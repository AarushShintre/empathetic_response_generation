To summarise, I get distracted from doing important things that I should do, but don't want to. To the point that it becomes impossible.\n\nSo for example, at work I have an expenses form that I need to fill out to claim back money I spent for work. I have to pay to park my company van, and sometimes I have to pay to fuel my company van also. The company will pay me back this money as long as I keep the receipts and enter the serial numbers into an excel sheet.\n\nThis is boring and tedious process, however it's important, because if I don't do it I'm literally losing a ton of money and won't be able to afford rent or food. Normal people can just do this. They hate it as much as me, but get it done and out of the way. I can do that if I'm properly medicated.\n\nI haven't done my expenses form for the last two months. If I don't fill it out by the first week of February, I won't be able to claim an entire months expenses. I still haven't started it.\n\nMy medicine has been in short supply, and the reason why I'm prescribed an extended release and instant release medicine is because I have to top up my dosage throughout the day to keep up with chores etc. My top up medicine is the one out of stock.\n\nMy rooms a complete mess, much like XQC's often is, and I've almost run out of clean clothes. \n\nAlso note how quickly I replied and wrote up paragraphs about my condition and yet I can't put a fraction of this effort towards something important such as my expenses form.\n\nEDIT: At a therapeutic dosage, i.e a proper dosage that's not excessive or too little, it helps me sleep as it declutters my brain. However a tiny bit more will keep me up for hours. I once stayed up for 3 or 4 days, I'm not sure, I thought it was 2 days and was getting worried. I was taking my dosage more frequently than I should as I wasn't paying close attention. I started seeing shadow people on day 4 and freaked the fuck out as I literally got rushed at by a dark figure, which wasn't real. I recoiled in horror and screamed. I also had to buy water and stepped outside, then got freaked the fuck out by a leaf blowing by. It was only a day after I managed to put together how long I was up for.\n\nAt the same time I've gone 7 weeks without taking my medicine as I forgot to take it and forgot to pick up my prescription before."

I can do that if I'm properly medicated.\n\nthe programmer in me just doesn't like the fact that your company has not automated this process yet - is that even possible? have you looked into Excel VBA macros or any general SQL querying? It might help you automate some of the logic you need to think about before say plugging in a value on a cell.. \n\nTry taking control back and see if you can try to improve your situation by teaching yourself something new and something that excites you and finally that can help you get out of it.. \n\nI hear your post so loud too.. I was just the same right when the pandemic started and I had to make massive sacrifices to get my life corrected and back on track. The only way that was possible was to limit my interactions with social media and try to keep calm and concentrate whatever little amount of focus I have into something I actually care about, not really my job perse, but anything that would make me happy..\n\nit sucked so hard in the beginning, but I kept at it, because I had no other choice, sink or swim right? But eventually, it became a habit. Now, I am up at 3 AM daily studying, doing my own things, being calm and relaxed way before my work starts at 8.. gives me time to slowly catch up to the day before anyone else does..\n\nI would highly recommend trying to force yourself to wake up a bit early every day and try not to fall asleep in the afternoon.. even if you do, limit it to 20 minutes so you don't go into deep REM sleep.. if you stay up all day after waking up at 4-5 AM, your body will automatically give out by 9 PM at the latest and  you will be sound asleep..\n\nI think sleep and a good diet are KEY to anything.. We can't do SQUAT if we don't have any GOOD energy to expend..\n\nI hope it gets better for you and everyone in this world. We're all with each other, we got this! <3 \n\nxqcL"

I agree with you about casual racism but I don't think 'acting black' is the culprit to any of this atleast not on its own, it could fully be beacuse he is half white which is something within the black community that is a legitimate problem.\n\n\"Blackness\" is not always tied to acting a certain way, in fact blackness truly can be skin deep as many members of the black community often will treat lighter members differently, and for mixed race children they too can experience racism not just for acting a certain away but for their genetics, aka having a non black parent.\n\nDr. Umar Johnson's rant about Naomi Osaka is a great example of this, he calls into question her blackness not because of how she acts but because she chooses to represent her home country over Haiti and he eludes to her not wanting to do so because she does not have pride in her Haitian side. This is a firm example in my opinion as this could quite possibly be similar to how people treat NMP. I could be wrong but again, it's not always about acting a certain way.\n\nIn fact, overt racism is overt racism, for all we know Bruce could elude to Nick not being black simply because he's half black despite him identifying as black and so on. Gate keeping blackness in the black community again is a real and prevalent thing that does not always go back to acting but also origin.\n\n\"not black enough\" goes beyond acting. I found the original poster's equation \"jumping around and screaming\" to be equated more with negative stereotypes they personally hold and to be truthful I think Bruce bringing up him being the black shield is more a strike on Nick not being fully black rather than how he acts.\n\nNo one should besmirch someone else because of their race, that's objectively true, but also, I'm saying that as a black person, it could be much deeper based on what I see in black spaces. As you may know, sometimes things can get pretty fuckin' racist. Now maybe Bruce has said \"You act too white\" to Nick, but all the same we agree on a fundamental level anyway."

Facebook specifically got in trouble for this because they were lying about what they did with the data and who had access to it. \n\nTiktok is currently in flux on whether or not it will be banned across the US because of their lying about what kinds of access the app has and data they collect. They are also lying about what they do with the data and who has access to it.\n\nAn example is an app saying they only collect in app data and whoami data. That's it. Except, they may also collect data on what other apps you use, how frequently you use certain apps (including phone, messaging, competition apps, etc), location information, what you may search on browsers...

The music itself sounds so similar because that's what sells. Anytime a group tries to do something outside the norm like Dreamcatcher trying to introduce punk-rock elements or KARD with their dancehall foray they either struggle to survive or are forced back into the fold to sell enough to survive. \n\nYeah I was obviously exaggerating with the milk comment but the 'style' you referenced isn't really present within the actual music, it's more the image, personalities and voices.\n\nThe fact that koreans just lack a solid underground scene that can publish and become famous outside of Korea and the music industry is really dominated by like 5-6 big companies who are just pumping shit out for quick profit hurts its development. There's no reason to take a chance on anyone doing anything original when you can create a group with some of the most liked personalities in kpop and milk it like cash cow(Got the Beat)"

Every generation watched less football during the past 3 years. But the key aspect when regarding the younger ones, is that they have so many alternative forms of media, that they're shifting away from TV, which is basically the only relevant medium for football, and with that, they're showing less interest in it.\n\nWith this in mind, RFEF and others might be interested in getting a foothold within some of these alternative mediums, like twitch. Instead of demanding the younger viewers come to TV, follow them to their prefered ways of consuming media. Which is what Kings League as very well capitalized on."

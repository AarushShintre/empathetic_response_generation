It doesn't take that much work to throw text under an icon, people do it for memes all the time. \n\nComedians say shocking things they don't mean for attention and laughs, often in bad taste. Gilbert Godfrey made jokes about 9/11 weeks after the attacks. Same after the Japanese nuclear power plant disaster Fukushima. I doubt he had antipathy towards the victims of either event and was merely 'doing his job'.\n\nJason Biggs was fired from TMNT 2012 for making inappropriate tweets his employers thought would damage the brand given he was voicing the lead in a series for children.

I don't need the person who draws crude cartoons to be a perfect person. The only thing I see is that he sent some creepy texts. Nothing illegal, no dick pics, no asking for nudes, no solicitation. And the DV we know NOTHING about yet.   \n\n\nI like what he created. I liked his voices, his characters, his sense of humor. I still do. He isn't my priest, he isn't a law maker. He makes dick and fart jokes and I honestly don't care if he sent some creepy texts 8 years ago to a 16 year old girl who held onto them for 8 years and released them right as his charges for DV dropped.  \n\n\nThink people will question any of this a bit more if those charges are dropped like his lawyer suspects?"

      "body": "The screenshots for the rape thing were posted on this sub before, but probably taken down due to not wanting this sub to become more about Justin as opposed to the show which is likely a good idea. \n\nScreenshots and videos is all that matters though. If I told you, Joe Burrow is a racist, and my friends and I heard him throwing out the hard R. He can admit to it, people won't care, because it's not video. If there's a video, motherfucker is gone. If there's a screenshot motherfucker is gone, because photo/video evidence is far more powerful even if the dude admits to his wrong doing.\n\nNot to target the NFL again, but there's multiple dudes that get suspended over domestic abuse, sometimes a few games, in rarer cases a season. However, this happens because no video evidence. Ray Rice punches his wife, and drags her out of the elevator. If there was no video evidence, he would've continued playing in the NFL. I mean this a dude who had four straight 1,100+ rushing yards seasons prior to this happening on video. \n\nLets say he was proven innocent by the court on the charges of 2020. I don't believe things will change. This storm that to be fair he caused with his history of being the way he is, and having multiple people accuse him of predatory actions, he fucked himself. Adult Swim, Squanch games, and Hulu all dropped him. \n\nIF I Was Justin, I would just be silent, and move on because his career is gone. It's very unlikely we'll hear from Justin Roiland ever again. Photographic evidence killed him, plus no 35 going on 36 year old should be talking to a 16 year old girl, and following up by describing her as \"Jailbait.\" He's a \"decent.\" looking person, he can talk to an adult woman. People would be more lenient if not for that particular conversation he had. \n\nHollywood is full of Justins, I mean fuck I don't know how in the hell Andy DIck isn't buried under a cell already. Motherfucker has like 20+ sexual misconduct charges, but \"I'm addicted help.\" saved him an awful lot."

If you say you saw them I believe you, but I myself have not, can't find them, and again: HOW has nobody brought these back out?  \n\n\nI have no doubt Justin is cancelled for good. People do not get uncancelled. I just question how quickly and efficiently it was done. Nothing known about the DV charges, some creepy texts that were held onto for 8 years, and the other I seen on twitter showing messages...were when she was 20 years old. But said they had been talking since she was a teenager.  \n\n\nThose texts are bad. They are creepy. But they are not illegal. It doesn't even fall anywhere close to actual legally defined grooming. It rides a fine line though."

Rape, and grooming are two things i don't wish anyone to be associated with for clear obvious reasons. If I ever stumble upon them on reddit, I'll link you. \n\nAS for those texts, it's just unfortunate and sad, I'm more sad over Solar Opposites admittedly.  A lot of times people who hold onto messages because they care about the person who did harmful things to them. If I recall the girl who was 16 at the time, mentioned she didn't initially come forward because she was a fan of RnM, and didn't want him hurt from it. That's a 16 year old mindset, now fast forward to 24 and your brain is more functioning, you can use reason to say hey, no this needs to be said. \n\nThose text messages, be it legit grooming or borderline near crossing it doesn't matter to the internet, and I don't think it should either. I think people would be more forgiving if he was 25, granted a 25 year old talking to a 16 year is kinda odd, at least to me, but a 35 year old talking to a 16 year old? To put that in perspective, he was already out of high school, and in college when she was still in her mothers womb. \n\nI mean fuck even Jerry questioned the robotic parents for allowing Birdman to get with their 16 year old daughter, I mean there's a lot of lines in RnM that now feel creepier than previously. \n\nSpecifically the pilot episode. \n\nRick basically has a drunken idea to kidnap 14 year old Jessica, and reassures Morty \"I'm not that type of guy.\" Then, mentions he went into a dimension in which he \"had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies.\" Followed by wanting Morty, a 14 year old to stuff giant seeds up his ass. \n\nWhen you watch this, and rewatch this it can obviously be diagnosed as dick and fart jokes, but given the context that we're slowing learning, it's becoming a bit more fucked. \n\nJail might be good for Justin, the consumption of alcohol could be a massive indicator for his fucked up shit he's been doing for a few years."

So if left to grow, Morty and Summer could also be genius level individuals like how we see evil Morty. \n\nSo to stop this Prime Rick gets C-137 to create the Rick curve where Rick is the main only genius and center of the universe basically. He causes Beth to not reach her peak or the rest of the family. Just like Jerry being a real man and taking control. \n\nI think if we see the other side where Evil Morty goes we will see a family where Beth is a surgeon, Jerry a CEO, Summer a productive and assertive woman, and Morty the genius on par to Rick.\n\nThe citadel realizes that combined they can manipulate the universe. Their greater genius tied together can be used to control and warp what ever they want. We see that are the ones that grow the mega seeds. Used to dumb down Morty\u2019s. They make deals all over the universe and galaxies.\n\nEdit: remember when the time guys come, the testicle guys and they fight with Rick and also fix the snake planet. I think having the Rick curve and all the Rick\u2019s together has something to do with the timeline and hide from the testicle time cops, being able to keep the time change possible and reversing. It helped stopped and correct the time line. So when Evil Morty blew up the curve it corrects his time line. Why I believe Prime Rick and C-137 are the same Rick, he used time travel portal but then used dimension portal to confuse C-137. Thinking it was another dimension Rick to search and then create the Rick curve.\n\nEdit 2: added that the Rick curve keeps the time change hidden away from time cops and able to stop the time change from reverting in that time, so things don\u2019t get corrected.

One won\u2019t survive. \n\nSo whats going to end up when they battle, we will get to continue with our show if C-137 lives or we get an entirely new show of Prime Rick lives.

Part of it is the pacing and timing of jokes, the jokes in themselves being less relevant or funny, and the forced changing of character interactions like Rick not being the same person or Jerry not being the butt of every joke. I dont know a soul that likes Space Beth and she's being inserted into every episode. Feels like the show got new writers, which means its a different style of humor and what would normally mitigate that change in humor is for characters to remain the same as they've always been (Family guy) yet they went for character arcs, effectively changing the humor and direction of the show."

In chemistry, you have to look at every molecule differently.  Here's another example -- again, sorry for nerding on you, lol.  Oxygen that we breath in binds with haemoglobin in our systym (blood) whereas nitrogen does not get to bind with blood, reason for is because it does not contain the binding protein complex to bind it. Again  humans are unable to utilize it in this manner, however it's still SUPER important as mixed nitrogen helps in amino acids that influence growth, hormones, brain function, etc.\n\nIn short -- If we were to mix just regular old air in bags of chips, they would mold because of oxidation.

Also a good way to not receive packages is to start giving your driver a hard time so that is IMO a horrible idea.

I honestly don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever dealt with someone who is not listening to delivery instructions because giving them more does not work you have to COST them something for making their mistake and at the end of the day if they put your package in wrong spot their is no way for them to prove you received it\u2026 unless they take picture which only verifies wrong product placement COSTING them money on their mistake.

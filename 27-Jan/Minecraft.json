It didn't discriminate or committed anything against anyone so I hardly think it \"wronged\" anybody. It just has a few bugs and isn't as advanced as Java which is expected if you are  attempting to shove a game like minecraft into a mobile port. \n\nFuther more, all I said is I MYSELF don't believe it need such hate. I didn't go. \"HOW DARE YOU HATE IT. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG.\" I know alot of people love doing that, but that's not what I intended. If you don't like it then that's great! If you like it that's also great! That's your opinion. Common sense should tell you that you don't have to agree with me.\n\nLastly, I don't think you've read the whole thing my friend, because in the end I said, everyone likes different versions of minecraft and I think that a game that can manage that has done something right and is pretty amazing. :]"

I recently played one that  had an entire cook book you can craft and use, it even allowed you to chop the food, animations and all! But then again, im not too savy with mods and I'm probably easily impressed, but I think some of the mods for Bedrock is pretty impressive and is worth the difficulty lol."

It's not showing the full path, so I might be missing something. The path should be like this C:\\\\Users\\\\*USERNAME*\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Packages\\\\Microsoft.4297127D64EC6\\_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\\\LocalCache\\\\Local\\\\runtime\\\\java-runtime-gamma\\\\windows-x64\\\\java-runtime-gamma\\\\bin\\\\javaw.exe If you find it, good. Why the launcher can't I don't know.\n\nThe second method is to download and install Java 17 yourself. For that go here [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) After installing Java and you're not sure where it was installed; go to Start and type **cmd** and select Command Prompt and type **echo %java\\_home%** then when you go there, look in the bin folder and you'll find the javaw.exe you'll need in the next part.\n\nThe next part is the same for both methods. In the launcher click on Installations. Select the one you want to use, or are having problems with. Click the 3-dots followed by Edit. Click More Options. Look for Java Executable and click Browse. Navigate to where the javaw.exe is you want to use. Click Save and try playing the instance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the missing .ogg file, I'm not 100% what to do there but here is what I would try. Make sure the launcher is not running. Go the the .minecraft folder (C:\\\\Users\\\\*USERNAME*\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\.minecraft) and rename it (suggestion: .minecraft-mine or -old). Open the launcher again and try to run the default instance, even if it isn't the one you want. Then try creating the MC version you want and test that. Yes you will lose the profiles you created and anything else you've added, but remember they are in the renamed folder. You can copy worlds, resource packs and datapacks over to the new folder. The profiles you'll be best to recreate instead of copying them over...that and I don't really know the perfect steps to that but they aren't that big of a deal to redo."

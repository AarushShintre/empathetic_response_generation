People don't complain like that about food. \"Only eat lobster every day\" or something silly like that. \n\nYears ago: I got a freelance job as this hack movie list compiler person. And I had to pitch ideas to the boss for columns. And he was hyper critical of which ones would get listed and would always want to shoehorn in his picks for whatever. \n\nAnd he wanted one that \"will appeal to women\" and I was adamant about putting together a true crime one. Because women love true crime. And I went back and forth with him for weeks on it and finally gave up because he was too stubborn. But I maintain my stance!"

Most theaters have a 7.1 setup too so Nolan isn't using them to their full potential.\n\nSince the film is going to be viewed in all of those formats shouldn't the dialogue at least be audible on all of them? Again something that every other widley distributed film manages to achieve. \n\n\n>Tenet was made for the best systems, so using Atmos would've been a no-brainer, however 70mm IMAX Film only has 6 tracks of audio on it so that could be the limiting factor. Nolan is a film purist after all.\n\nAnd in the past he's not had any issues with dialogue intelligibility when working within those limitations of film. Nobody ever complains about not being able to hear the dialogue in Inception or The Dark Knight. So although mixing in Atmos may be a solution to this problem, Nolan's refusal to do that isn't the root of the problem. Both he and countless other filmmakers have managed to make dialogue audible across multiple formats. Something has changed in his approach to sound that has really soured it for the audience. I hate having to read CC captions telling me that [stirring music continues]. But that's a choice Nolan and his production team are now forcing audiences to make. If poor dialogue sound is a common complaint with Oppenhiemer then I'll simply not pay to see it."

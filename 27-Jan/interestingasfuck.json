He went from 195lb/88kg, to 138lb/63kg. It took over two years before he gained any weight, and  another year to gain significant weight. By year 5 he was back to his original weight. He explained that his brain wanted food, but after 2 or 3 bites he was full. Then one day his appetite was back. \n\nAs soon as he was able, went to the gym and started working with a trainer to build strength and endurance. It was a slow process. He's back to playing sports recreationally. \n\nHe's also been seeing a psychologist from his cancer center since his diagnosis. It helps to be able to talk to someone who isn't friends or family. \n\nHow are you doing overall?"

Even if they could afford the loan or even pay cash. An area that may be well known to the general public (grottos) or to a select few who act as a wizard behind the scenes. \n\nThis type of systemic racism (where it is literally built into the definition of how to live in society) would reject people from getting a home or business loan and give them the run around till they gave up. \n\nI'm from Metro Detroit. We have a very famous red line. 8 mile (as in Eminem). It maybe where the term red line came from (I'd like to know for sure). There was a map that had a red pencil that drew a line from Lake St. Claire along 8 mile to some other road going North/south that boxed the core of Detroit. Along much of 8 mile, to this very day, there is an 8 foot wall that was put up along the neighborhood part (would open up for the main roads) to help keep walkers from exploring north. The wall was put up under the disguise to reduce the sound from the main throughway that 8 mile is. People could travel north all they wanted but they could not live and reduced their ability to work outside of that area. Buses would have their routes not cross those zones and would force people to take connectors increasing the irritation and hassle to reduce the amount of people who would be willing to go outside of those zones. \n\nWhere it all came to a head was the aging car factories would need to build a new factory. But the only places without high density to build a new massive building (many an entire mile long) would be north of Detroit. Metro Detroit. So the old factories would close and the white people would buy new homes near the new factory with the nice schools and parks. But black people were stuck with no jobs, aging housing and schools which means increasing crime. Which brings us to the race riots of 1968. \n\nThese angers boiled in the summer in many cities (Detroit, Atlanta, LA, DC, Baltimore..). Sparked in large by the systemic racism from Vietnam war, assassination of MLK and everything engrained. This is where President Johnson stepped up and kind of addressed the issues. \n\nMy mother remembers National Guard tanks rolling down her street during the riots. Curfews, crime (my grandmother had someone walk into her home to rob to place or worse and she ended up stabbing the guy), police brutality (the number dead on record is not the real number killed as told to me by a guy who was a cop then), fires... All of this led to a mass exodus of whites leaving the city. Because they could. Slowly red lining was dropped (more like expanded). In the 80's crack destroyed what little soul was left in the city as the people left there were victims of the system and trapped in learned helplessness. \n\nToday it is coming back. The heart of Detroit has always been nice to visit. Now there are more zones that are nice to visit, work and even live in. But it's taken 70 years to turn it around. \n\nThat's just the tip of what red lining is. All for what gain? Noting that it is going on today; maybe not in home loans but certainly in other forms. Take for instance health insurance. \n\n\n\nPBS did an hour segment on Red Lining focusing on Springfield, IL and Dayton, OH. It's also on YouTube. \n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/video/redlining-mapping-inequality-in-dayton-springfield-kam44p/\n\n\nDo you live in a city that was defined this way?"

That\u2019s our government at work and I\u2019m sure both sides have people profiting. To call it slavery though is half baked at best. I\u2019ll agree though, it\u2019s wrong. I\u2019ve always heard of for profit prisons, but never knew much. I\u2019m gonna look into it and maybe I\u2019ll be more understanding. I enjoy these conversations because a lot of times it\u2019ll open your eyes to a different viewpoint. I\u2019ll disagree on slavery, but agree on for profit prisons and cops needing to clean their shit up. I\u2019ve spent several days in jail myself, and come to find out years later the jailer had a side job with the commissary company. He was fired from jail, or should say resigned, but still pedals commissary. I put $100 in mine when I had to do 5 days, and they never once let me out of the drunk tank. I was told I could shower and brush teeth, but I stayed in the same room all 5 days without either. Transferred the $ to a friend who was in there when I left.  Granted, I felt I deserved to be in there, but should\u2019ve been able to brush my teeth.

There's only so many books in the library, and being in your cell/bed will eat you alive if you let it. $12-24 a month is mighty appealing when you don't have anyone on the streets looking out for you."

      "body": "In theory, sure. But your state pay, as it is known, it's based off what you are \"classed\" as, and hits your account on the Thursday of the first full week. This isn't prorated, it's usually a lump sum. 24 is the current max for state stipend, and that particular pay rate is reserved for things like chaplains assistant, high ranking tutors, the top of the prison job food chain. If you manage to become a referee for some of the sports being played, the recreational coordinator has the option of awarding you an additional .50 per game you referee. The average pay for serving up state food or sitting in class is $18 a month. College students get $20. If you have no job at all, $12 a month. On the opposite side of this coin, if you have someone supporting you, the most you can spend in commissary is $100 a week, which will let you live a fair bit more comfortable than what they give you. The downside? All of your food has to fit inside a 2.4 cubic foot locker box, and you'd be smart to keep your receipts to prove you didn't steal any of it in the likely event that you get searched."

The level of stipend is often seen as \"hey, better than nothing\", by most, but it does help things along. A pack of ramen a night at .23 a meal helps with the hunger pains, as some things that are served tend to be less than palatable. I wouldn't go so far as to say it motivates, but it's a bright spot on the otherwise blight ridden piece of fruit which is your life, for however long you're a ward of the state. As for how many persons rely on state pay alone, the population is a microcosm of what you see in the world. You have those who have no one, and then there are persons who are financially independent, and of course everywhere in-between. Illegal gambling, drugs, gang activity, extortion, blackmail... these are all factors which may impact someone's need for state pay/outside support."

Evolution is change. Evolution is not \"only that change which leads to positive outcomes\".\n\nEver hear of an evolutionary dead end? Mutations can happen which may temporarily benefit a species, but ultimately were a bad direction for it to take. Nonetheless, that is still evolution.\n\nAlso, if a mutation occurs, and the animal nevever breeds, that's still part of evolution. That's evolution saying \"you're not fit enough to continue your lineage\".\n\nYou can't have natural selection where only GOOD selections count. Natural selection is the sum of both good and bad. \n\n> Evolution requires several other factors in order to happen\n\nThe ONLY factor required for evolution is that a change makes it more likely for the animal to reproduce. If you reproduce less, the change will propograte less. If you reproduce more it will propogate more.\n\nIf a human was born who was immortal, but he never had any kids becuase he was also sterile, that change, no matter how beneficial it would be to mankind, would not spread.\n\n> Spoiler: we didn't just mutate and out compete them.\n\nExcept that is exactly what happened. For whatever reason, we out competed them. We had more babies, and they either died off because they didn't breed enough, or because we killed them.

There is nothing in between. Either it mutates, or it does not. And if it mutates, which it does, something about the animal changes. Maybe that makes it more fit for survival, and that leads it to produce more offspring. If they happens enough, the change becomes ingrained in the species. That's evolution.\n\n>  which is why sharks and crocodiles have remained unchanged for millions of years.\n\nSharks and crocodiles have remained unchanged because they reached a point where they were very good at doing what they do and any mutations that have occurred in individuals did not result in those individuals out competing the rest of them.\n\nAlso saying that sharks have remained unchanged is not correct in the first place. There isn't one species of shark. There are many. \n\nThere are also many different species of crocodiles:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile\n\nYou don't even know that crocodiles and sharks are actually many different species, and that crocodile and shark are simply the name for a family of animals that covers many species.\n\nAnd there are also several species of crocodiles which have died out. Here's one which died out just 4,000 years ago:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekosuchus\n\n> Historians of science have noted that, while Darwin considered the ideas in Wallace's paper to be essentially the same as his own, there were differences.[122] Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge.\n\nSpoiler: IT'S BOTH.\n\nAnd also both result from mutations in DNA which get carried forward to future generations.\n\nPS: Perhaps you're confused by \"mutations\". When I say mutations in DNA I am not just referring to the sort of mutations that occur if DNA breaks. I am referring also to changes that happen when two parents with their different DNA mate and they produce a new offspring with combined DNA that is different from both. A child of two short parents can result in a child who is much taller. These \"mutations\" can spread to future generations just as easily as random mutations from cosmic radiation might."

And if it was their environment then it killed them off because they had not evolved to survive in it, and they did not evolve quickly enough to survive, much like the dinosaurs when the asteroid hit and temperatures dropped worldwide.\n\n> The evidence we have from early human contact is that we interbred with other human species, and most hominids didn't come into contact with us at all.\n\nThat's cool, and has nothing to do with the discussion at hand. I do not care why specifically early hominids died off. It is irrelevant in a discussion about what evolution is and how it is all driven by changes in genetics at the lowest level of abstraction.\n\nAnimals mate. They combine their DNA. Mutations occur somtimes. Sometimes those mutations or the changes that result from combining their DNA are beneficial. Sometimes they are not. Regardless of whether they are or not, it is still evolution at work. \n\nTo say otherwise is to say it is not gambling if you happen to lose that day at the casino. Futhermore, if you win, but get robbed in the parking lot by someone with a gun at the end of the day, you still gambled.\n\nSo early hominids still took part in the process of evolution, even if they were ultimately wiped out because their environment changed, or mankind came along and killed them all. They just didn't evolve in a way which enabled them to survive. Mankind did. The end.\n\nLiterally everything that happens to you every day is the END RESULT of billions of years of evolution. So if some dude stabs you in the gut and you die, you died because evolution made people violent, and your genes didn't make you strong enough to survive that encounter."

Therefore it is not. And it will not be regardless of whether you take one and raise it outside the safety of that environment. It has no instinct to be afraid, just as we laregly bred fear of people out of dogs and cats by domesticating them.\n\nAlso, if you take the same species, like a squirrel, and you place it in two distinct envrionments like the city and the country, it will behave somewhat differently. But guess what? That's also due to evolution. It evolved to be malleable because malleable means a greater chance of survival."

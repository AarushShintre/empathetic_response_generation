You can\u2019t create energy from nothing and energy can\u2019t be destroyed.\n\nTwo people with the exact same lifestyle will have the same body habitus. Thin people are thin because they eat less on average and expend more energy on average. Fat people expend less energy and eat more energy on average. It\u2019s not any more complicated than that.  This is basic nutrition science and physics.\n\n>50 years ago the US nation was very thin. Several things changed during that time: dramatic increase in food consumption (energy), dramatic increase in food availability, catastrophic decrease in energy output.  \n\nI don\u2019t think people realize this but we basically climb out of bed, walk 20 feet to our car, sit all day at work, walk 20 feet back to our car, sit on our couch for 4 hours, and then lay down to sleep for 8 hours. Almost zero energy is being output.\n\nSo when you combine that with the ubiquity of food you get fat people. It\u2019s like a giant science experiment we are doing on ourselves. Transport the same fat person back to 1964 and they will be normal sized in no time."

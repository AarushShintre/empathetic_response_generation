So they are doing it for power but the moment the Kremlin has it they will purge, it plays out over and over again in history.\n\nOn top of that, the US market and the West is a much more lucrative market and Saudi Arabia has many investments here as well as customers from energy to banking to platforms to transportation and more.

Saudi Arabia is only 30m people. Saudi relies on US weapons to defend, they'd easily get overrun by Iran, Russia or China.\n\nThe reason we are allies with Saudis is the same reason we are allies with Israel, they are at least somewhat West friendly at least at the diplomatic and market level.\n\nRussia/China will only \"partner\" or make \"deals\" when they fully have leverage, it is a weakness of their authoritarian systems.

Do we just allow them to leave, because anyway to bring them in, if it causes pain, is torture?

I have lost my keys multiple times and somehow managed to just carry on with my life with only minor inconvenience.\n\nOf course you're then going to manufacture some scenario where I only have one set of keys, and I have somehow placed myself in a situation where without the keys I will die, because I don't know I drove my car out to the middle of the Sahara desert and then someone rode up on a camel and stole them?\n\nAre you seriously this ridiculous?\n\nLook man, for me in particular stealing my life savings is not really a thing that could happen, stealing my keys or even my wallet is barely an inconvenience and CERTAINLY not worth physical violence.\n\nSo I don't know what to tell you. If you distort your scenarios to become life threatening then it becomes self defense, something that I wholly support, even if it causes pain, injury or death to whoever I am defending myself against.\n\nBut I am not willing to inflict violence upon someone for property."

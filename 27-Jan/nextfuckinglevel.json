You're only allowed 1 buck per season, and there's a draw for calf/female licenses every year, but they give most of them to 1st year hunters. Most people have salt licks, they feed apples, carrots, and grain months before the season. Even then, a lot of them spend years without tagging one. \n\nIt wasn't my point though, I meant that in some areas, salt licks and feeding is allowed, but live bait is illegal. From early summer to fall, bait, feed and minerals are selling like toilet paper early pandemic. It probably brings in more tax money than deer and fishing licenses"

Here, only a few older men who spent years walking and hunting the same forest can track deer successfully.\n\nFor us, those garbage piece of shit hunters are usually those who don't have access to private land or aren't leasing a lot. They drive around dirt roads with a loaded rifle and an open beer, shooting at first sight no matter where it is, trespassing and braking property. We own land, and we have to push back agressive entitled hunters every year. We catch some poaching, breaking our main gate to trespass, and the list goes on."

It stays \"wet\" for a long time after that. it's not like glue drying, it's a reaction like cement and similarly still has water in it after it's set up. You can break it just fine when it's wet or dry. It would be tough to paint on a plaster ceiling or wall, as most famous frescos are, on goopy unset plaster in less than 30 minutes. Also, oil pigment would still seep into dry plaster just fine- possibly even better without the water sealing it out. It's chalky and porous."

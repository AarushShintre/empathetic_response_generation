Nor would the Greater Will.\n... But here we are... The Fingers, dormant, severing our link to the Greater Will.\nThe realm, and all life, in ruins. Impossible events transpire, beyond the ken of the Fingers.\nWho is to say that the cardinal sin must be cardinal forever?\nGo on. Finish the job. Take the course you deem most worthy.\"\n\nThe grace still guides you to the Fire giant and the power to burn the roots.

Maybe I'll start one, just because I haven't done it yet.\n\nAnd yeah, I get that everything costs something. The guy I was originally replying to didn't seem to think that light roll had a cost. So then I guess I would say that the cost for light roll is probably about the same as the cost for high poise.

There's alot of variety in the dex path and some of it hits very hard.\n\nLike, instead of focusing arcane, you can get two katanas that do bleed damage and make them keen with default bleed and instead of focusing on bleed, do a shitload of base damage and then have bleed stack up eventually to like, help.\n\nThat's what my strength build does with cestus. It uses the spiked one but its heavy and the ash buffs its damage and moveset and I use rotten wing and millicents to up the damage on repeat attacks and while they technically do bleed, I built them for pure damage.\n\nYou can do the same with katanas and dex, and bonus if you keen the weapon you can still put any ash on it \\*and use weapon buffs on it.\\* \n\nDepends on how you wanna play it, but you can do alot with dex."

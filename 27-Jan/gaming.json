And again, the definition requires actually trying so your argument does not meet the definition because at some point with enough training you can do things without trying - that doesn't mean the effort you put into the training magically disappears, it just means that it shows how much effort went into getting to where you are today.

I work with teens in my career and what I\u2019m finding is what they demand from games is very different.

Then compare it to your future self, exactly 1 year from now. We're going to pretend you have exactly $100k to allocate, you just won the lottery, include that in your NW. \n\nIf you buy a GIC, you know your NW will be +$2500. With mortgage, instead of paying $5740 in interest, you will pay $5740 more in principle (this year) so you now own that much more of your house. If you do the math correctly, your NW will increase by exactly $5740. Your principle at the beginning of the year was $400K, at the end of the year it will be $505574 (plus whatever else was suppose to go towards principle this year, that was a constant, the bank controlled that part). \n\nYou're really only ($5740-2500) $3240 better off; so if there's a break fee, that sucks. But if you do the same exercise over 2 years, it becomes (11480-5000) $6480 higher Net worth. If that's bigger than the break fee, its worth doing. If it isn't, you actually end up slightly worse off. \n\nAssume no other savings for this exercise; we need to keep it simple or we'll get bogged down in hypotheticals. Also assume your payments stay constant and no change in house value (that's a secondary thing). \n\nI don't have a good excel sheet to share, but there's a few out there that illustrate prepayments."

Over the past decade, all the little details were irrelevant (low rates, no one was prepaying).\n\nI agree, on $30k, you'll save $1,722/year ($5166 total over 3 years), the break fee is not worth it.

About the hindsight :), i checked with another lender last week and he said, I wouldn't qualify now for a new mortgage with the total amount and my income I have now with this rate. The reason why I got it in the first place is, as he said, the rate was low at the time, so pre-qualification went through. That got me curious and was reading up online, it seems 30% of all mortgages in Canada now are only paying monthly for the Interest ALONE, so basically like paying rent :)"

I was explaining why it's not the case, and those GICs would be covered.\n\nHonestly, Oaken has better rates than TD, is easy to deal with, gives you the choice between Home Bank and Home Trust Company as issuer (separate CDIC members), they'll direct deposit to whatever acct you want at maturity. Only thing is that you have to send them a cheque for the initial deposit."

You can hold stocks and ETF's, bonds, GIC's, mutual funds and other eligible investments (just like an RRSP). You can also have MULTIPLE TFSA accounts such as one at a brokerage for your investments, and one for cash savings at another institution.\n\n**Question: How do I figure out my TFSA limit?**\n\nAnswer: Now is a good time for us to mention that you should sign up for CRA MyAccount since if you had it you would be able to check online right now. You can also call the CRA to ask about your TFSA limit (be prepared to identify yourself using prior year tax return information). Be aware that the CRA does not always have up-to-date information and that the limit is typically only updated yearly! Therefore it will not be likely to be updated for any current year activity. \n\n**Question: How do I report my TFSA on my tax return?**\n\nAnswer: You don't! The reporting of TFSA contributions, withdrawals, and income activity is taken care of by the institution that holds your TFSA.\n\n**Question: What is my contribution room?**\n\nAnswer: Your contribution room is based on the years that you meet all three conditions of: 18 or older, valid SIN and a tax resident of Canada. You do not get TFSA contribution room for years that you do not meet all three conditions (ie: do not have a valid SIN or are a non-resident of Canada). What happens inside your TFSA (holdings go up or down in value), has no impact on your contribution room. To refer to the different amounts in various years, see the CRA website: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "body": ">What percentage of my income should I set aside in my budget to invest\n\nIf the investment is for your retirement ...\n\nIn Fred Vettese's most recent book, *The Rule of 30*, he demonstrates that people without pensions should be able to retire in their mid 60s and maintain their lifestyle - even if they experience a very unlucky combination of inflation, wage inflation and investment returns - if starting sometime in their 30s they earmark 30% of their gross income to rent/ mortgage + daycare expenses + retirement savings.  (But recommends that they do an annual assessment starting about 10 years from retirement.)\nThe point of the book is that it is important to save for retirement but, because there is more to life than retirement, you should spread out the pain over the accumulation phase. (Having undue hardship in the early accumulation phase and excess spending money in retirement is just as undesirable as spending excessively in the early accumulation phase and having undue hardship in retirement.) \n Vettese's strategy acknowledges that when you are paying rent, building a down payment, paying off student loans and paying for daycare it can be impossible to put anything away for retirement.  He wrote that the retirement specific savings could end up something like:\n- In your 30s save 5% of gross income.\n\n- In your 40s save 15% of gross income.\n\n- In your 50s save 25% of gross income.\n\nOf course if someone wants to retire before their mid 60s they would have to amend the rule to save more and/ or save earlier.\n\n>how I do I analyze stocks, index funds and bonds?\n\nThe current price for any stock or sector is based on the market's opinion of what it is worth and that opinion includes the expectations for future growth. The only way that the stock or sector will beat the average market is if it exceeds those expectations.  Before you would choose to invest in or overweight a stock or sector you should know why you are confident that it will exceed the market's expectations, which includes the expectations of professionals who study these companies and less experienced investors who invest for less rational reasons.  \n\nDo you know anything that the market doesn't know?  \n\nDoes the market know something that you don't know?\n\n\nAs Warren Buffet says,\n\n>\"The goal of the nonprofessional should not be to pick winners \u2014 neither he nor his \u201chelpers\u201d can do that \u2014 but should rather be to own a cross section of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well... the \u201cknow-nothing\u201d investor who both diversifies and keeps his costs minimal is virtually certain to get satisfactory results. Indeed, the unsophisticated investor who is realistic about his shortcomings is likely to obtain better long-term results than the knowledgeable professional who is blind to even a single weakness.\"\n\n>\"A low-cost index fund is the most sensible equity investment for the great majority of investors\"\n\nIf you want to use a brokerage account to purchase a low cost, globally diversified, index tracking portfolio that suits your goals, timeline, knowledge, experience and tolerance for volatility, I  suggest that you follow the steps on [this CPM page.](https://www.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/model-etf-portfolios/)"

Due to the pandemic it was tough to get a sale and tenants were few and far between, at least quality ones that checked out. \n\nWe took the unit off the market in Dec and at the same time were referred to a management company for a friends and family discount. We were offered a 6% rate instead of the industry standard of 8 - 10%. I was work from home at the time and couldn't step away often to show the unit so we decided to go with the management company. They were able to find a tenant for Jan 1, 2022. The fees are tax write offs too so not bad.\n\nThe other rentals we have are still being self managed myself.

You can hold stocks and ETF's, bonds, GIC's, mutual funds and other eligible investments (just like an RRSP). You can also have MULTIPLE TFSA accounts such as one at a brokerage for your investments, and one for cash savings at another institution.\n\n**Question: How do I figure out my TFSA limit?**\n\nAnswer: Now is a good time for us to mention that you should sign up for CRA MyAccount since if you had it you would be able to check online right now. You can also call the CRA to ask about your TFSA limit (be prepared to identify yourself using prior year tax return information). Be aware that the CRA does not always have up-to-date information and that the limit is typically only updated yearly! Therefore it will not be likely to be updated for any current year activity. \n\n**Question: How do I report my TFSA on my tax return?**\n\nAnswer: You don't! The reporting of TFSA contributions, withdrawals, and income activity is taken care of by the institution that holds your TFSA.\n\n**Question: What is my contribution room?**\n\nAnswer: Your contribution room is based on the years that you meet all three conditions of: 18 or older, valid SIN and a tax resident of Canada. You do not get TFSA contribution room for years that you do not meet all three conditions (ie: do not have a valid SIN or are a non-resident of Canada). What happens inside your TFSA (holdings go up or down in value), has no impact on your contribution room. To refer to the different amounts in various years, see the CRA website: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The contractor / employee tests are still relevant.\n\n>If you have one company as a source of income you\u2019re a PSB.

If CRA actually, successfully enforces this for doctors working for hospitals, well, there will need to be some separate government action to keep those doctors working in hospital.

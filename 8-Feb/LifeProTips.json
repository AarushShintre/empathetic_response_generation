Celulose is hydrophilic and sucks moisture from the environment.  It's not even that dry in the first place.  Potassium sorbate is added as a mold inhibitor.  How long potassium sorbate works depends on what you're trying to preserve, which in this case is probably less than you think.    \n\n\nIf you buy that big Costco tube of cheese, it's going to grow mold before you use all of it, and you're going to eat it if you don't have a habit of staring in your spaghetti."

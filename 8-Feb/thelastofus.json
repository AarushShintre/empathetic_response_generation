Another user pointed out diary entries that mention stuff DID happen during their trip, and I kinda feel like this was a bandaid solution by the developers to address the issue I'm feeling. It's just that it's telling me that something happened instead of showing me.\n\nTo be clear, despite the amount of words I've already devoted to this topic, I don't see this as a huge issue.

Where Joel is still trying to not be vulnerable and have anything deeper with Ellie. He is keeping her at arms length. And that WOULDN'T have changed until Eps 4.

And we dont even see if catilina is really fireflies, though I prefer not to mention anything from part 2 as I only care about the first game. Thats what matters. Part 2 or future  games can change it retroactively so doesnt matter.\n\nAnd Joel and Ellie were looking for the fireflies because it was joels job. He wasnt looking for them to go with. Sam and Henry were in one of the zones fireflies helped collapse, how were they doing! They had no other choice . Find them or be hunted. So neither of your examples really speak highly for the fireflies. One was paid to find them, another was fleeing from a zone they helped collapse.\n\nIn part one, we see them bomb civillian used checkpoints.  In part 2, and im loath to even mention it,  but they show you blood on the walls in museum level written by a former firefly who confesses all the evil shit they were told to do for the \u201cgreater good\u201d. It always baffles me they put that in when part 2 seemed determined to retroactively make the fireflies look good.  But there was also dialogue with dina about a firefly who quit when they forced him to bomb a checkpoint to kill people. And as mentioned before, we saw several qzs fireflies helped overthrow in the first game. Everyone was dead or hunters.\n\nAs for people dying to get into the qzs, we see at the start of part one people infected trying to sneak into the quarantine zones. Joel and tessa remark that lots of people are willing to die just to risk getting into them."

I think that could still happen, either by teaching Ellie a few words, or with Henry translating. \n\nI don't know if you've interacted with deaf people before, but from classroom experience I know they tend to be pretty skilled at communicating non-verbally. When you use words to communicate, you don't do as much gesturally, with facial expression, with body language and so on, as a non-verbal person. Even if you're not fluent in ASL, I think simple ideas like \"you're not scared, why?\" would be quite straightforward to understand. Maybe Sam lip-reads, or Ellie writes a response. It's not that complicated to hold a conversation with a deaf person really, there's lots of tools you can use.\n\nJoel managed to tell Ellie \"They can't see, but they can hear\" non-verbally, in Ep. 2. I wonder if that might be a little bit of foreshadowing for the idea that people have generally had to learn to communicate more quietly in this world because it's so dangerous travelling through these places. In some ways, Henry and Sam's fluency with ASL is probably a tremendous advantage - they can talk to each other silently, even over short distances, in ways most people might not."

Multiple articles say the capacity for ammo manufacturing for American consumption is 8 billion a year with half of it being 22LR. So that makes an issue with the 25 Trillon number. It would take 23,000 years of not shooting a single round to come up to 25 Trillion.  Does you still think 25 trillion is the right number? That same single article said we have 600 million guns in America. But every other article says we have 120 guns per 100 people. That's less than 400 million guns. \n\nWe are just arguing hypotheticals now. I'm the exception for ammo and gun owning. During the pandemic, I borrowed out hundreds of rounds to a bunch of people. These are very typical gun owners that I have to remind they need to have more than two boxes of ammo. I think most would burn through their ammo in less than a year. And whales that have large stock piles (besides the military) will have theirs go missing once the fighting gets going. Hopefully we never find out the reality."

But wouldn't think that's an inconceivable number, but I'm guessing the 25 Trillion would factor in ALL types of rounds, not just small arms, and that would likely be in the entire world.\n\nBut forget the 25 trillion number, we don't even have to use that to make a point. Let's say ALL of the reserves were shot out or lost, and we only had what the US produced in one SINGLE year to have for the apocalypse.\n\nLet's say all the years and decades of stockpiles disappeared and all we had were the 8-12 billion rounds we produced in that single year. That's still 595,327-892,990 rounds per 13,438 McDonald's. Imagine how many McDonald's you see, that's 600-900 thousand rounds at every one of those locations.\n\nAgain, this is all hypotheticals like you said, but I just don't see it being that hard to find ammo in the US, in an apocalypse when you have 20 years of scavenging."

      "body": "I'll try to explain it again:\n\nThe Fireflies took Ellie away and prepped her up for surgery to make a cure. To make the cure, they had to kill Ellie. Objectively, this is wronging Ellie since they are literally killing her. The Fireflies' choice in taking Ellie away and make a cure is what forced Joel to make a choice: just leave, and let a girl who cared, trusted and depended on him be taken away and killed for a cure, or to save her.\n\nJoel's actions at the hospital were in *self-defense* of the girl who was put on that operating table. Ask yourself, did Ellie deserve to die? \n\nBefore you go \"does everyone else deserve to die by infection\", think about it. Cordyceps is literally a force of nature. Everyone has the same chances of survival. It wasn't Ellie's fault she is immune, but because of that immunity she is going to get killed. Does Ellie deserve that fate? If she wasn't immune, she would have never been put on that operating table.\n\nSaving Ellie/not killing her for a cure isn't putting her life above everyone else's, it is valuing her life *equal* to everyone else. Killing Ellie for a cure is valuing her life *less* than everyone else.\n\nThe cure and the choices of both Fireflies and Joel are very subjective and very morally grey on both sides; we see discussion about it still going on today. However, there is one thing that is truly objective in the hospital - that the Fireflies were wronging Ellie by choosing to kill her for a cure. I get that they might\u2019ve preferred not to kill her, but the fact is to make the cure you had to kill Ellie - and that is wronging her (because you\u2019re literally killing her). Did the Fireflies even realize that they are killing a little girl and this isn\u2019t entirely a right thing? Did they realize that they are wronging Ellie by killing her, or did they not even consider her and instead only focused on the ends (vaccine) and see all their actions as fully righteous?\n\nIt was not Joel who ruined Abby's life, but rather her father's choice in killing Ellie. It was *understandable* that she killed Joel. But by her torture of Joel and the brutality of how she did it, she ruined Ellie's life. Did Ellie deserve this? Ellie was Abby's victim, and Abby, not even once, showed any realization towards Ellie for what she did to her - despite her being in the same position she was."

As it happens the kind of knowledge required to conduct an amputation does not meet the same standards as the kind of knowledge needed to conduct modern epidemiological research.\n\n>How are people able to drive cars? I never saw a single driver's license.\n\nLicensing has nothing to do with the *knowledge* to drive a car, the license allows you to legally operate the vehicle but you can learn how to drive without one. Most people don't go to the DMV to take their license exam and that is where they LEARN how to drive. This is a lazy rebuttal. Also cars are literally engineered to be comfortable and intuitive for us to drive, it's very simple to understand how to drive a car with only a little bit of instruction and practice.\n\n>How are people able to use military equipment? The military educational system has collapsed!\n\nI don't know what \"Military equipment\" means in this context so I can't meaningfully respond - If you mean like guns then once again guns are designed to be comfortable and intuitive for people to use. You almost cant hold a gun wrong. I literally don't know what the hell 'the military educational system' is but like.. Seemingly that's not true? Ellie was trained to shoot in FEDRA school, Abby learned to be an end of the world supersoldier in the WLF. Surely these blatant examples qualify as a 'military educational system'?\n\n>How is Ellie able to handle a bow? I never saw her in a licenced archery school. She is clearly a fraud.\n\nWe don't know who taught her to shoot a bow, but I don't think most people who learn do so at a 'licensed archery school' what even is that? Someone just shows you how to shoot, it's extremely simple. I can shoot a bow and I didn't even know that a licensed archery school was an option. Knowing how to knock and draw an arrow takes seconds to learn, practice to get good at. Knowing how to develop vaccines takes many many years of directed study in collaboration with other people who already have deep knowledge of the field with access to huge amounts of material and equipment for testing, iterating and learning.\n\n>In science fiction they might call this the plot\n\nIf you are arguing that your position is a contrivance for the purpose of moving the narrative along faster then you are fundamentally acknowledging that all the things you've read from me are true, but you have low expectations for the writing and you don't think it's worth deeper consideration.

To be crass, people straight up fuck without knowing names fairly often. It's not as rare, rushed, or \"forced\" as you are making it out to be. \n\nLook at the context of what we saw. Bill was isolated for 4 years (if not more) from human contact. He was very lonely. Frank was also isolated and spent the recent days/weeks traveling in fear and seeing the 9 people he was with killed. On top of not eating for days, he drank wine for the first time in forever, clearly having a low alcohol tolerance. I'm gonna assume you're not gay so you have no idea what it's like to find someone like you. Frank was able to pick up on Bill being gay throughout dinner and at the piano scene. You can tell he gets emotional just listening to him play and sing. We see Bill is emotional and already longing for connection from when he gives Frank clothes while he's in the shower.

Another big red flag is that the shows success, not the games, will determine if they make another game. You\u2019d think if the game was so good and so successful it would warrant another, right? Another big red flag is the poor user scores the game gets compared to the good reviews it gets from big time reviewers.

The bond Joel and Ellie form is really special and she pulls Joel out of the dark pit he was in through her empathy and child like wonder about things. Their journey together is a joy to play.\n\nIn Part 2, the journey in the cutscenes is probably the most gruelling part of the experience. There are pockets of joy that I find and Ellie's journal is always interesting for me to flip through and dissect. \n\nFor me, I relate deeply to both versions of Ellie because I've been both versions of Ellie in one way or another. Part 1 Ellie when I was younger and even now. Part 2 Ellie in the way I creatively express myself and her emotions and decisions resonate with different parts of my life when I was struggling with grief, hatred, and obsession. \n\nIt explores love too, but it's definitely complicated. I had a complicated relationship with one of my parents so to me it felt real for Ellie to have a lot to process about Joel.\n\nTo be fair though, I have a high tolerance for doom and gloom and pain, and I don't expect everyone else to. Part 1 is definitely easier to get through and I admit has a much more lovable quality about it. There's nothing wrong with resonating more with one story over the other. Part 2 puts you through a lot of negative emotions so I don't blame you for having a sort of disconnect with it. I hardly liked it much myself during my first playthrough, until the end.\n\nBut you're right, it does look and play wonderfully and I keep going back to it for that reason too.\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts with us!"

She becomes >!almost unrecognizable and its horrifying to watch her descent, especially since we can see how much she is actually hurting herself<! Over time in part1 she did become desensitized to violence - like so many of these children of war have had to - but remained beautiful Ellie nonetheless.\n\nI don't think we were necessarily supposed to LOVE Abby in part2, even though so many of us did. We couldn't spend as much time with her as we have at that point with Joel and Ellie and she's not as sweet and quirky and sassy and open with her emotions as Ellie was. She's also older than Ellie was and has already >!done the terrible kinds of things Ellie is currently in the process of doing<! which makes it even more difficult for us to emotionally connect with her. \n\nI do think the writers intent was for us to feel exactly what you feel - understanding and empathy for this 'other' who has done really horrible things in her life, one in particular to Ellie and to us personally, but is still capable of change and growth and kindness. It's much more difficult to empathize with someone who has hurt us but when we see that seed grow in her and watch her become the loving version of herself we can understand that she is Joel here. And that, yes, people can come back from these terrible mental states and behaviors, that this kind of change is possible for anyone.\n\nWe were able to forgive, or at least overlook, Joel's similarly brutal past because we understood his motivations and felt empathy for him. We wanted him to heal and become the loving generous kind dad guy we knew he could be. When he did, it was beautiful, and he became the first example for us that these things are possible. Abby's character arc shows us a second example. I don't think Ellie's arc is finished but I do think it is the third.\n\nBut of course, none of that means we have to actually like Abby. Or feel the same joy in this version of Ellie.\n\nEdit: for spoiler tags"

      "body": ">If what you said was that the video game format allows for a richer main relationship between the main character and the main side character, that would be different. I would still disagree, but that is not what you said.\n\nThat is exactly what I said. Its literally the central pillar of my entire argument. That videogames can't provide richer details compared to TV in some aspects of storytelling is your argument, not mine. \n\nThe Museum scene was just one example. You can't say that \"oh, that one gameplay section provided meaningful character development but all the other ones in the games didn't.\" That is a non-sensical argument. The vast majority of the character development in that Museum scene happened during gameplay. The gameplay itself was meaningless in that scene lol, it was a flashback. How is it possible that just one such scene could provide so much rich character development and incredible dialogue but all other such sequences in the games are \"Meaningless?\"\n\n>No it fucking isn't true because your statement was NOT specific to the main characters, period. You are changing your argument just so you can save face and claim you were right all along.\n\nI did not change my augment, I just didn't expect someone to differentiate like that when nearly all of the side characters are temporary at best in this particular story. Fair enough though, I admit that the show has done a much better job with most if not all side characters, at least so far. Can you admit that the game has done a better job with the main characters? Because from several of your statements you appear to be inherently biased against the viability of video games in general as a rich story telling medium. That is a position I could not possibly disagree with more."

You are not reading my comments in good faith here. My whole point was that most of the character development in that flashback **did not** happen through gameplay banter. There's the cutscene where Ellie is pushed in the water showing she can swim, there's the space capsule cutscene, and there's the ending cutscene that establishes Ellie's doubts (Ellie touching her arm while the graffiti spells LIAR). What does the gameplay banter *add* to those cutscenes in terms of information? Almsot nothing. You just enjoy the banter because you enjoy the relationship, but it brings basically nothing new to the table\n\n>Can you admit that the game has done a better job with the main characters?\n\nNo, because I don't think it can be argued to be \"better\" in any objective sense. There really isn't all that much more character development in the game (up to and including Bill's town) for Joel and Ellie than in the show. There's more dialogue for sure, but how much of that dialogue builds on the relationship and how much of it is just endearing you to it through sheer exposure? I'd argue it's much more of the latter. And considering the audience stats for the show, pulling in more viewers each week than the game sold copies in **six years**, viewer investment in the relationship doesn't seem to be a problem for the show.\n\nAdditionally, on a broader storytelling perspective, I'm not sure it's inherently \"good\" to have the viewer be so much more attached to Ellie than Joel is supposed to be. The entire story is articulated around a pivot point, that is when Joel stops trying to get rid of Ellie and starts willingly engaging in the relationship. This is supposed to happen in Jackson, where he makes the **choice** to take care of her (before that he was just honoring Tess' last wish, it was not his choice). \n\nBut in the game, the viewer spends hours with just Joel and Ellie and there needs to be dialogue otherwise the game would be unbelievably boring, so there are hours of dialogue endearing you to the relationship through sheer exposure that is required to keep you slightly engaged. Therefore the player ends up WAY more invested in the relationship than Joel is, and it makes his choice to take care of her in Jackson much less impactful because from the player's point of view it seems so obvious that they need to keep going on this journey together.\n\nSo I'm actually in support of the show's relationship being more of a slow burn, I think it supports the story better. In that sense the game's relationship isn't inherently \"better\", but I agree that it endears the viewer more. For better or worse."

Because they are all dead by this point, right? I shouldn't need to clarify my original statement, its implied if you've actually played the games. By the time they leave Bills, so the end of Ep. 3, they are literally the last characters (that we've seen) remaining in the show besides Tommy. To claim that it is somehow a detriment to focus on this relationship is.... insane?\n\nFrom your statements I can only conclude that you have not actually played the games and your only exposure to them is through watching Youtube videos of the cut scenes. The show is very good, I have already told you that, but if Craig Mazin had the same disdain for videogames as a storytelling medium that you do then the show would be complete and total shit. \n\nThe cut scenes alone are not a substitute for the game in any way.

      "body": ">I would expect you to know who the main characters were and that every single one of the supporting characters in the story are all completely irrelevant except for as character development for the main characters.\n\nYOU WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT MAIN CHARACTERS ALONE. Stop moving the goalposts just because you want to be right and refuse to admit you just said something dumb. what you said was \"the game is able to give us more richness and detail within individual relationships and characters than the show is capable of doing without boring the audience.\"\n\nWhy is RELATIONSHIPS in plural form if you were only talking about Joel and Ellie? Because you fucking weren't. What you said was wrong, video games are NOT able to give more detail within relationships *in general*, they are heavily liumited by the video game medium in only giving us detail within relationships *with the main character* and only with abundant screen time to accomodate for gameplay. Given the same screen time for characters TV shows are UNEQUIVOCALLY better able at giving detail in relationships, by virtue of not needing to dedicate as much time to gameplay.\n\n>To claim that it is somehow a detriment to focus on this relationship is.... insane?\n\nIt is a detriment not because focusing on one relationship is bad, but because the video game medium IMPOSES that limitation on storytelling. Bill and Frank's story as it exists in episode 3 could not exist in the video game because video games are hamstrung by the need for a single POV dominated by gameplay. It is objectively a limitation in the types of stories that can be told in a video game.\n\nAnd in the specific case of TLOU, I'm saying it is a bit of a detriment because the Joel-Ellie relationship gets so much screentime that viewers end up way more invested than Joel himself is supposed to be narratively, which detracts from the impact of the choice he makes to take care of her in Jackson. More development of the relationship isn't always inherently good if the relationship is not meant to be developed that much. My argument here is that the Joel-Ellie relationship is FORCED to be overdeveloped because if it weren't, the game would be insanely boring to play. The video game format forces the relationship to be overdeveloped. It's a narrative limitation of the medium.\n\n>From your statements I can only conclude that you have not actually played the games and your only exposure to them is through watching Youtube videos of the cut scenes.\n\nI have played TLOU1 at least 4 times and I have 500 hours on TLOU2. So how about you fuck right  off with that logic? Just because I acknowledge the limitations of the medium doesn't mean I can't enjoy it.\n\n>if Craig Mazin had the same disdain for videogames as a storytelling medium that you do then the show would be complete and total shit.\n\nI don't have any disdain for video games as a storytelling medium. But when it comes to portraying relationships TV shows are unequivocally a better storytelling tool. On the other hand, the fish factory sequence in *What Remains of Edith Finch* could never be as successfully adapted into a TV show than it is in the game. Keep in mind this entire argument is about YOU claiming that video games can provide deeper relationships than TV shows can. This is NOT a discussion of video games as a storytelling medium IN GENERAL."

I\u2019ll look at them and do my best but if i have any doubts, I\u2019ll DM you.\nMy idea of putting the design on a store bought wellet was to just use paint or a sharpie. I did this on the inside of my old wallet and it worked ok, but I\u2019m not sure it would work so well on the outside."

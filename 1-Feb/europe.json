Remember, Thaci was still in charge, and the KLA soldiers were just moved to another armed organisation with essentially the same leadership structure.

No, it doesnt openly state that. But it shows you the data, it shows you the tactics, and its shows you the development, which, if you have just a tiny basic modicum of logic, you would realise spells out \"yeah they mainly targetted civilians\". Most of their victims were civilians. Much of their violence happened after the war, where, you guessed it, the only targets were civilians.\n\nThere were very few, and they suffered from witness intimidation. No, my point is correct, you can quite literally look up how that court was formed, it was on EU recommendation and EU pressure. As you are well aware after all, Kosovars largely *hate* the court. When Salih was convicted for 26 years for his war crimes, you were very opposed to that ruling and called him a \"hero\" who \"didnt deserve to go to prison\". \n\nThe one currently prosecuting him?

But it's not correct, there was no years of pressure, and the main opposition was VV. \n\nMy and every Kosovar opinion on Thaci aint positive but we will have to wait for court to decide whether he was a criminal or not. And, the organ harvesting accusation have never been proven to be true. \n\n\u201cThree parallel international investigations, by war crimes investigators from Serbia, the European Union, and the Council of Europe, have failed to uncover any evidence that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) trafficked any organs, according to sources close to each investigation.\u201d Also The Special Chamber (established in 2017) is a court of Kosovo located in the Hague, currently set up for delegating the trials of the crimes committed by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).

And you of course know that because you asked the Serbs who were displaced about why they are no longer in Kosovo, right? Whats that? You didnt? Because you know if you did not a single one would give you the answer you falsely tried to claim was a common one? Who knew.\n\nIt doesnt matter, because it doesnt boil down to individuals. It was the organisation. The attacks were too widespread, too coordinated and too uniform to be a lot of individual cases. They were organised.  And given that the KLA was known for its tactics of murder, abduction, expulsion and torture of specifically civilians, with Thaci specifically known as being brutal, yeah, its clear who gave the orders.\n\nNo, it was not. Im not sure why youre using that case as an example in the first place, given it was a miscarriage of justice, but it also didnt even say what you (falsely) claim it says. At most what it said was \"the KLA only targetted *specific* civilians\", which isnt correct, but again, this *was* a miscarraige of justice. Remember, this was when the US was pushing the ICTY to make sure Serbs and only Serbs would be properly prosectued, while making sure that Kosovar war criminals would get off. \n\nLimaj for example was acquitted because the judges found that it didnt quite meet the standards of beyond reasonable doubt (Not correct, but again, miscarriage of justice), while acknowleding that \"there is a strong possibility apparent on the evidence that Fatmir limaj was active as a commander in the prison camp at times relevant to the Indictment\". I.e., \"yeah he did it, but the evidence isnt quite strong enough\". \n\nThere were years of pressure. After the ICTY, where the US made sure Kosovar war crimes would be swept under the rug, failed to bring people to justice, the EU had to keep pressuring Kosovo to finally establish the court, and even then had to specifically ask the court to be *outside* of Kosovo given the risks.\n\nThaci was elected president by 92% of the vote. At a time when his crimes were very well known. Sorry, but I plain dont believe you. And no, they have. As you can see [here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/14/kosovo-prime-minister-llike-mafia-boss). In fact, it turned out the EU had earlier dismissed the same claims without investigation, until someone investigated and found \"wait shit, that was totally true\". \n\nThe special trial chamber is limited in what it can do. His other crimes are enough to indict him, but now, decades later, evidence for the organ harvesting is hard to come by. Some witnesses died even iirc. I wonder what happened to them.\n\nAnd yeah no. You guys, as a whole, are opposed to the special trial chamber. [Here](https://balkaninsight.com/2022/12/16/conviction-of-kosovos-commander-cali-sparks-anger-at-home/) is an article about your reaction to Salih being brought to justice.

This doesn't excuse Hitler in any way but the late Weimar governments were idiots and by appointing Schacht as president of the central bank the Nazis solved the crisis relatively quickly. They solved it of course by using the Mefo-Wechsel to fund the war machinery for an attack war (and this was probably only sustainable if we assume eventual war-profit from an attack war) but you could have used the same scheme to fund other areas of industry that would have actually improved peoples lives (similar to the New Deal but actually much more succesful). The nazis basically elimintated unemployment by 1939 both by refloating money into the economy via the Mefo-Wechsel and also by massive state spending - and this was in itself sensible. It wasn't sensible to use all this labour to build a massive war machinery but Schacht got many of the basic economics right.\n\nNote: This is of course not because Hitler had a clue about economy. I doubt that but he had the right guy to fix many of the issues and its a bit hard to blame the people for electing fascists when the undemocratic Hindenburg appointed governments literally ran the country into the ground. As I said in another comment, if you want to discredit fascists the first step is to not be a complete imbecile. The late Weimar cabinets failed that hurdle.\n\nAgain this is not meant as an apology but important context to understand history better. People vote with their stomachs and they weren't really tricked. Hitler actually solved the problem. He eliminated labour rights in the process, exterminated the jews and many other people and eventually destroyed Germany in a way never seen before but he did appoint Schacht who fixed deflation and unemployment. The problem was in my view that first of all there shouldn't have been undemocratic Pr\u00e4sidialkabinette that legitimized autocracy but also that these people were sadly idiots. It's not like they or even the last Weimar coalitions made it that hard for Hitler. They governed terribly - and terrible governments create an ideal breading ground for fascists."

I have no idea at all what prompted me to do the maths other than the wife saying about how expensive that was and how she only pays \u00a33 for 9 at Lidl. \n\nThe trouble is that once I'd found that out I then went off and looked at some other stuff too.\n\nEdit: The maths:\n\n[Florasys, Lidl's own brand rolls](https://www.lidl.co.uk/p/floralys/floralys-quilted-toilet-tissue/p973), are 160 sheets per roll so in the 9 pack you get 9x160=1440 sheets for \u00a33.09.\n\nCushelle you get 360 sheets per roll so 9 rolls of Lidl's is the equivalent of 4 rolls of Cushelle - 1440 sheets /360 sheets per roll = 4 rolls. \n\nWith me so far?\n[4 rolls of Cushelle is a third of the 12 pack which is \u00a312.15](https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/311678586) so the cost of 4 rolls and therefore 1440 sheets of toilet roll is a third of \u00a312.15 so \u00a33.05p.\nIt therefore works out that for 1440 sheets of toilet paper it's 4p cheaper to buy the 12 rolls of Cushelle at \u00a312.15 a pack of 12 than it is to buy 9 rolls of Lidls own brand at \u00a33.09p a pack of 9."

Slow authorization and arrival of aid have not been the only factors limiting Ukraine\u2019s ability to launch continued large-scale counter-offensive operations. Factors endogenous to the Ukrainian military and Ukrainian political decision-making have also contributed to delaying counteroffensives. ISW is not prepared to assess that all Ukrainian military decisions have been optimal. (ISW does not, in fact, assess Ukrainian military decision-making in these updates at all. Yet, as historians, we have not observed flawless military decision-making in any war.) But Ukraine does not have a significant domestic military industry to turn to in the absence of Western support. Western hesitancy to supply weapons during wartime took insufficient account of the predictable requirement to shift Ukraine from Soviet to Western systems as soon as the West committed to helping Ukraine fight off Russia's 2022 invasion.\r  \n\r  \nThe military aid provided by the US-led Western coalition has been essential to Ukraine\u2019s survival, and this report\u2019s critiques illustrate the importance of that aid as well as its limitations. Western military advising before the February 24 invasion helped the Ukrainian military resist the initial Russian invasion. Western weapons systems such as the Javelin anti-tank missile helped Ukraine defeat that onslaught and throw the Russian drive on Kyiv back to its starting points. The provision of essential Soviet-era weapons systems and munitions by members of the Western coalition has kept the Ukrainian military operating throughout the war. The delivery of more advanced Western systems such as the US-produced 155mm artillery (in April) and then HIMARS (in June) facilitated the Ukrainian counter-offensives that liberated most of Kharkiv Oblast and then western Kherson Oblast.\\[1\\] The arrival of Western NASAMS air-defense systems in November helped blunt the Russian drone and missile campaign attacking Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.\\[2\\]\r  \n\r  \nThe war has unfolded so far in three major periods. The Russians had the initiative and were on the offensive from February 24 through July 3, 2022, whereupon their attacks culminated. The Ukrainians seized the initiative and began large-scale counteroffensives in August, continuing through the liberation of western Kherson Oblast on November 11. Ukraine has been unable to initiate a new major counter-offensive since then, allowing the conflict to settle into positional warfare and allowing the Russians the opportunity to regain the initiative if they choose and to raise the bar for future Ukrainian counteroffensives even if they do not. The pattern of delivery of Western aid has powerfully shaped the pattern of this conflict.\r  \n\r  \nWestern reluctance to begin supplying Ukraine with higher-end Western weapons systems, particularly tanks, long-range strike systems, and air-defense systems, has limited Ukraine\u2019s ability to initiate and continue large-scale counter-offensive operations."

Weapons and supplies are always central to the planning and execution of sound campaigns, however. Ukraine had no meaningful defense industry going into the war and was therefore almost entirely reliant on its Western backers to provide the materiel it needed to stop the initial Russian offensive and then, even more so, to initiate and sustain counter-offensives. The patterns of Western aid thus heavily shaped Ukraine\u2019s ability to develop and execute sound campaign plans.\r  \n\r  \nThe Russian invasion began on February 24, 2022. The only major phase of Russian offensive operations continued through the capture of Lysychansk on July 3.\\[3\\] Russian offensive operations then culminated, and Russia lost the initiative in July.\r  \n\r  \nIndicators that the Russian offensives would culminate and that Western weapons would be needed at scale emerged clearly in late May and June. ISW observed on May 28 that \u201cUkraine may have a chance to launch significant counteroffensives with good prospects for success.\u201d\\[4\\] The West had been sending Ukraine Soviet-era equipment and ammunition to resupply and replace Ukraine\u2019s Soviet systems, but Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) Head Vadym Skibitsky warned on June 10 that Ukrainian forces were running low on Soviet supplies.\\[5\\] Western officials began publicly warning that stocks of Soviet-era materiel were running low on June 24.\\[6\\] The United States authorized the delivery of 155mm howitzers on April 21, and those systems began arriving in Ukraine on April 29.\\[7\\]The United States authorized HIMARS in late May, which began arriving on June 23.\\[8\\] The Western coalition did not prepare to provide Ukraine with armored vehicles during this period."

The Western coalition has no capacity to produce Russian weapons or ammunition at scale, so the exhaustion of the Cold War holdovers of those systems clearly indicated that the West would have to shift Ukraine to full reliance on Western systems in order for Ukraine to have any military at all in the future, to say nothing of supporting Ukraine\u2019s continued ability to fight a protracted war against Russia. The West should therefore have begun setting conditions to shift Ukraine onto the use of Western weapons platforms, including tanks, artillery, and aircraft, by early summer 2022 and in advance of the forecasted culmination of Russian offensive operations.\r  \n\r  \nUkraine used what systems the West made available to it to take advantage of the window of opportunity presented by the Russian culmination following the seizure of Lysychansk on July 3, 2022, to initiate counter-offensive operations. Ukrainian forces began using US-provided HIMARS systems to set conditions for counter-offensives in both Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts in July. Ukraine launched its first major counter-offensive, in Kharkiv Oblast, on September 6. That counter-offensive was a stunning success, recouping over 12,000 square kilometers of territory in a six-day lightning advance that overran and destroyed some of the most elite mechanized units in the Russian military.  \n\n\nThe Ukrainians followed the Kharkiv counter-offensive with a counter-offensive in Kherson Oblast. They began setting conditions for operations in Kherson as early as July 23, escalating in September and October, and culminating in the Russian withdrawal from western Kherson Oblast on November 11, 2022. That counter-offensive proceeded much more slowly and cautiously than the Kharkiv counteroffensive had, partly because the Ukrainians wanted to avoid fighting in (and thereby destroying) the city of Kherson, but largely because by that point they feared running out of counter-offensive capabilities. The West was still refusing to supply armored vehicles and was increasingly warning about Western shortages of supply even of the artillery systems and munitions it was providing.  \nHad the West begun providing Ukraine the equipment it needed for sustained counter-offensive operations as the Russian offensives were culminating, it might have been possible for Ukraine to begin those counter-offensive operations earlier.\\[14\\] If the West had begun working to shift Ukraine fully to Western systems when the need to do so had become apparent in the summer of 2022, conditions could have been set to allow Ukraine to continue counter-offensive operations after Kherson and thereby deprive the Russians of the ability to reconstitute their forces and attempt to regain the initiative."

      "body": "Western delays in providing Ukraine the materiel needed for counter-offensive operations have instead had a snowballing effect on Ukrainian abilities to conduct and sustain counter-offensives. Having failed to begin setting conditions to send Ukraine armored vehicles in May and June, when the need was becoming apparent, the West still did not prepare to do so when the Ukrainian counter-offensives began. The Ukrainians thus lacked any assurance that they would receive replacements for weapons systems lost or damaged in a new counter-offensive and therefore likely became more cautious in deciding to initiate and continue counter-offensives after liberating western Kherson Oblast.\r  \n\r  \nFailure to commit to providing counter-offensive materiel at scale after the conclusion of the Kherson counter-offensive has contributed to delays in the initiation of any further counter-offensives. The effects of that failure and of the cautiousness it likely induced in Ukrainian leaders may help explain the fact that Ukrainian officials routinely indicated that they intended to continue counteroffensives in the winter of 2022 and 2023 while some Western officials said instead that they anticipated a lull in fighting during the winter and therefore did not see any urgency in providing additional materials.\\[15\\] Ukrainian forces, in any event, have not initiated a new large-scale counter-offensive following the Russian withdrawal from west bank Kherson Oblast in mid-November.  \nThe Russians have taken advantage of these delays and failures to benefit from the windows of vulnerability their own defeats and incompetence produced by mobilizing manpower and equipment and starting to rationalize their own forces. They renewed their offensive against Bakhmut in late July, although it picked up steam only when Wagner Forces began leaning into it (although without making significant territorial gains) in October-November. The Bakhmut offensive coincided with the dramatic air campaign against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure that started on October 10 and made use of Russia\u2019s remaining stocks of precision missiles as well as drones that Moscow procured from Iran. Both the Bakhmut offensive and the missile-drone campaign put pressure on Ukraine that distracted from efforts to prepare for further counter-offensives\u2014the Bakhmut offensive by drawing Ukrainian reinforcements to the defense of the city and the infrastructure attacks by diverting Ukrainian command attention from the battlefield.

The best way is for Georgia to recognise that Abkhazia is gone but both can be close partners, and break the Russian presence in Abkhazia via that. Then even the status of Megrels or already elderly displaced people will be negotiable, as well as cultural rights in Kodori and vice versa. Instead, your government pushes things to what it is. Do you genuinely think that people love to be dependent on that specific country with a real imperial nerve, and that genocided and mass exiled its population? \n\nAbkhazia will never become part of Russia though.

Again, you can do better. \n\nIn 1991, Basayev was directed by GRU agents, and he praised the Russian GRU's \"professionalism\" and \"courage\", during his war against the Georgians.\u00a0\n\nhttps://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Shamil_Basayev\n\n\nBasayev became the commander-in-chief of the forces of the\u00a0Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus\u00a0(a volunteer unit of pan-Caucasian\u00a0nationalists, people from the\u00a0Caucasus). Their involvement was crucial in the\u00a0Abkhazian war\u00a0and in October 1993 the Georgian government suffered a decisive military defeat. It was rumored that the volunteers were trained and supplied by some part of the Russian army's\u00a0GRU\u00a0military intelligence\u00a0service. According to\u00a0The Independent\u00a0journalist\u00a0Patrick Cockburn, \"cooperation between Mr Basayev and the Russian army is not so surprising as it sounds. In 1992\u201393 he is widely believed to have received assistance from the GRU when he and his brother Shirvani fought in Abkhazia, a breakaway part of Georgia.\"\n\nRussian special forces joined with the Chechens under Basayev to attack Georgia. A GRU agent, Anton Surikov, had extensive connections with Basayev. Russian military intelligence had ordered Basayev to support the Abkhaz.\n\nThe Russians allowed Basayev to travel between Russia and Abkhazia to battle the Georgians.\n\nBasayev received direct military training from the GRU since the Abkhaz were backed by Russia. Other Chechens also were trained by the GRU in warfare, many of these Chechens who fought for the Russians in Abkhazia against Georgia had fought for Azerbaijan against Armenia in the\u00a0First Nagorno-Karabakh War.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamil_Basayev\n\n\nP.S.

You're trying too much to portray good old Caucasian assistance and standing with the small guy or kindred as some covert Russian operation, especially when the bulk of volunteers were from people whom Russia had genocided, and from people who then went onto fight against Russia.\n\n> I'm sorry, but there's no point in arguing with you, because you're talking like a typical Russian-brainwashed Abkhazian.

Not more than you asking Georgia to be separated from the USSR. Abkhazia is independent already, there is nothing to separate more, besides separating North Caucasus from Russia. \n\nI'm not even from Abkhazia but from the Abkhaz diaspora that has been exiled from Abkhazia during the genocide. And that's the common knowledge among the diaspora, both before and after the Abkhaz-Georgian War. That's also in ordinary Routledge sources as well, the history is clear. \n\n> On the contrary, the Georgian elite tried to protect the Abkhazians.\n\nClergy or some elite trying to save some Abkhaz doesn't change what had happened.\n\n> Russia did not consider them Christians, because part of the Abkhazians were Muslims.\n\nRussia didn't care if they were Christians or not. Huge portions of Circassians and Abkhaz were Christians, and still ended up in exile or slaughtered. Portions of my extended families also have the same surname on the Georgian and Circassian side, and all were Christian and both the Abkhaz and Circassian portions got exiled and slaughtered.

Which means that in the event of Russian aggression against Baltics, those countries would leave and NATO collapses.\n\nBecause it's either NATO provides credible defense for its members and Russia wouldn't dare to attack - then there is no problem with Ukraine's membership, this would deter Russia.\n\nOr the only reason why NATO is effective is not because of their credible defense, but because Russia wasn't motivated (until recently) to attack any existing NATO member - and then when Russia becomes motivated and attacks - NATO collapses. If that's the case - then Ukraine's membership is a problem, but then it's just makes it obvious for Ukraine that it needs to solve their problem differently and without NATO, it just proves that NATO is a bluff.\n\nAnd this will become clear to other members of NATO, in particular to Poland.

When that happens populations will be transferred, so they are not **permanent**. Some of the population will lose citizenship and have to go back to Turkey.

Poland and Romania have almost tripled their GDP per capita since joining the EU, and by 2050 they're projected to be on par with Spain and Italy.\n\nBut that doesn't matter, other countries DONT MATTER. What matters is that member states benefit as the EU is an economic union. And that's not how growth works, it's completely unrealistic to except growth to continue that much.\n> So? If UA was nato, this wouldn't have happened in the first place.\n\nDon't you see that that would have been bad for NATO? This situation is very much preferred to one where Russia never would have invaded. It's a dream scenario for everyone except for Ukraine. \n\n> Well, the whole point of the EU is to increase wealth and business, dumbass.\n\nSee the first point. A rich Ukraine doesn't matter. \n\n> Literally nobody cares lol\n\nEveryone cares. If the only thing a country is able is its people, then they better be highly educated. AS we have enough unskilled labour already from eastern europe. We don't need more.\n\n> The exact same thing could be said for the entire eastern bloc. Yet, here we are now with the eastern bloc having a GDP of 1.8 trillion and still growing at insane rates.\n\nAnd it was absolutely a mistake, we should never have expanded that much. And it's going to be the end of us. Imagine how rich WE could have been by being able to exploit those countries.\n\n> Idk what point you're arguing here but literally all of it is dumb. Either come back with something of value or don't reply lol\n\nThe point you are failing to grasp is that no countries beyond NATO and the EU matter. While this is all great for Ukraine, why would that matter? It simply doesn't.\n\nIf we didn't sanction Russia and just sent military aid as we do now, we would have been TRILLIONS richer and the only one it would hurt is Ukraine."

And so when Albanians take up arms to fight against this police-state apparatus that segregates them, they are called terrorists?\n\nWhile there were War Crimes in our side too since its a war after all, KLA's goal was not going after the Serbian civilians, nor does some individuals commiting war crimes change anything.\n\n>Which would make sense if it was Serbia that started the war and not KLA. I'm not denying Milosevic cleansed Kosovo of Albanians, but the ethnic cleansing didn't happen until NATO bombing in March of 1999. The war started more than a year earlier.\n\nAgain, completely leaving out what was happening in Kosovo.\n\n*\"By the mid-1990s, institutionalized human rights abuses had significantly devalued the value of life in Kosovo. The state itself was institutionalizing violence and murder. In 1994, the head of the highest court in Kosovo bluntly stated that 'when one(an Albanian) is accused of violating the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, we can beat them and even kill them.Amnesty International reported in 1994 that the police used violence on a daily basis and with impunity. The report continued by stating that 'thousands of ethnic Albanians have witnessed police violence or experienced it at first hand.Hundreds of cases in which Kosovar Albanians were subjected to systematic torture in custody, a system supported and perpetuated by the judiciary in flagrant breach of Yugoslav law.\"* Here before a single bullet being fired.\n\n>Fair enough, but Albanian extremism in Kosovo began in early 80s (but actually since the 50s), long before Milosevic took power and in the time Kosovo had autonomy. How exactly is that explained?\n\nPrior to Milosevic, things in Kosovo were tense, but not about to burst into flames, and you are reaching way too much with the 50s. \n\nAlbanians and Serbs had reached an impasse regarding the political status of Kosovo. Albanians wanted it as a republic within Yugoslavia, so that Albanians would be considered an equal peoples within a federation with their own home republic.  On the other hand, Serbs believed that Kosovo should not be a republic, because then it would subject Serbia to treatment that other republics did not face (having a region of its republic declared autonomous and then become a republic in Yugoslavia). So there the matter stood.\n\n>You deliberately didn't include the word \"basically\"\n\nI genuinely missed the word basically, but again, that's simply wrong, and I have no idea how you came to that conclusion."

So we are talking of a Serboslavia and myths and legends not a Yugoslavia in here?\n6. So much autonomy that about 100k Albanians were sent to Turkey.\n\n>I actually do, because other than giving jobs with power to Serbs and typical repression that all ethnic groups suffered in the 50s, i didn't find anything specifically pertaining to Albanians.\n\nKosovo\u2019s territory was literally considered too vulnerable to be given major industrial projects, and Yugoslav communist leaders decided that Kosovo could provide raw materials for other, more industrialized, parts of Yugoslavia. These economic decisions were politically motivated, and in the long term, they contributed to Kosovo\u2019s status as the most undeveloped region of Yugoslavia. For example Kosovo\u2019s social product per capita was 49% of the Yugoslav average in 1947 and by 1962 it had fallen to 33%, that's 1962 only.\n\nThere were multiple policies promoted by Serb nationalist that were employed against Albanians that involved terrorisation and multiple harassments.\n\nThousands of Yugoslavs were brought to Kosovo as colonizers [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav\\_colonization\\_of\\_Kosovo#:\\~:text=The%20colonization%20of%20Kosovo%20was,1918%E2%80%931941)%20until%201999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_colonization_of_Kosovo#:~:text=The%20colonization%20of%20Kosovo%20was,1918%E2%80%931941)%20until%201999).\n\nThousands of Albanians were sent to Turkey.\n\nThe position changed from 74' to and went back to \"normal\" after the death of Tito."

This is complete nonsense. \n\nFirst of all, what the fuck are you even trying to say?\n\nWe / YOU were talking about allied escalation - which implies actions on the part of an ally that might escalate the situation with Russia. \n\nNo one is concerned about Russia \"escalating\" against any single party, because they can't. There is already a coalition. The US is already in the boat. Any \"escalation\" would be against all parties and met by all parties. It doesn't matter that Germany is non-nuclear, because the US is nuclear, and France is nuclear and so on. \n\nWhat you (before you twisted yourself into an illogical knot) and Scholz (per your hypothesis) and the US were conceivably worried about was an action on the part of the allies that spurred Russia to say \"fuck it\" and escalate regardless of the fact that all parties respond. That's the risk, not that a single party incurs idiosyncratic danger from Russia, if that were the case then Germany would look like WAY more deplorable and cowardly than they already do because Estonia, and Poland, and Finland and so on have taken WAY more aggressive action than Germany ever has and they're theoretically at WAY higher risk of Russian action. \n\nIN WHICH CASE, Russia doesn't care anywhere nearly as much about Germany as they do about the US. If they give much of a shit at all about Germany. The escalation risk (which is equal for all allies) is WAY higher if the US escalates than if Germany escalates. Hence why the pretense you're constructing for Germany's terrible performance here is completely fucking irrational. If Scholz is worried about the wellbeing of 450M people against the threat of Russian nuclear escalation, then the LAST thing he should be doing should be predicating Germany's actions on the US escalating more and first."

You are confusing my argument once again but I will try to make a distinction:  \n\n\nThe Albanians you are referring to left their home because of environment which was polluted and had lung cancer ( ironically some say it is because of NATO bombs of depleted uranium causing this), they have come for better life.   \n\n\nThey were NOT fleeing Serbs because Serbian aggression has been stopped.   \n\n\nOn the OTHER HAND, you WON'T FIND Serbs who are fleeing NEITHER the case such as the beforementioned one, NOR those WHO ARE ETHNICALLY PERSECUTED.  \n\n\nSerbs KNOW that if they LEAVE THEIR HOMELAND, THEY WILL NEVER EVER NEVER NEVER GET BACK HOME.  \n\n\nWould you give out your house for free ?   \n\n\n>The wholesale expulsion of an \"ethnic group\" from your nation is considered a genocide by the UN btw. So, what you call \"defying expulsion\", I would call \"resisting a genocide\". Pretty big difference of perspective there when you spend even one single second being objective. But you're not capable. You've consumed Russian propo your whole life. It's not your fault.\n\nUnless you consider affiliate media of CNN = Russian propaganda, be my guest. I am quite vary of local trash of media, much more so Russian trash. No need to equate me with Russians, and if anything, you are insulting me for no reason whatsoever, unless you wish every Serb you meet to turn into Ruzzian bootlicker with that attitude.   \n\n\n>So, what you call \"defying expulsion\", I would call \"resisting a genocide\".\n\nOh God. FUCKING FINALLY. So you see, whenever any Serb says this, they get told it's Ruzzian propaganda and it's just an isolated case. One key figure is that your government is silent about this genocide and if anything, whole western alliance keeps ignoring it. Do you see now what is going on ?  \n\n\nIf you understood this little part, and concluded that \" NATO/ West should force Albanians to stop doing genocide\" then we have come to a reasonable conclusion."

This is largely a German created problem due to their defunding of their military, their ignoring of Eastern European concerns, and their encouragement of Russian integration and dependence on gas, their denial of Ukrainian entry to NATO, and their tepid response to the 2014 invasion. Germany should be taking the lead on the solution. \n\n3. Biden doesn't have unlimited money, and the Republicans control Congress. If the US, who already sends the vast majority of military aid, also sends all the tanks, many Republicans will screech 'WHY ARENT THE EUROPEANS DOING ANYTHING TO DEFEND THEMSELVES' \n\nLots of right wingers are already complaining of the aid already sent to Ukraine, let alone more. \n\n4. Similar to 3 - there are rumours that the US is supplying f16s in mid April. They probably won't have money for Abrams, Bradley, their existing aid, as well as f16 in the Ukraine aid budget.\n\nMeanwhile, tanks are something that Europe CAN handle, whereas f16s probably aren't. Let people do what they are good at. \n\n5. If Russia sees that Ukraine army is largely Bradleys, HIMARS, Abrams, and f16 it plays into their narrative that Ukraine is a US puppet, and that the US is invading. \n\n6. It's not as complicated as the media makes it, but the Abrams is actually pretty maintenance and fuel intensive, and a supply chain across the ocean is harder than a short rail or road trip from Germany. \n\n7.

Amos suggests that obstacles--such as the sea, glaciers, or mountains--on the route from Africa to the Middle East, across the Himalayas and over the Bering Strait, held many migrants back, so that a much smaller group moved on, producing offspring to inhabit new parts of the globe. Changes in climate may also have opened and closed new routes out of Africa, creating new barriers.

      "body": "German industry cannot replace Ukraine Leopard\n\n>Governments of all stripes slashed the budget for the German Bundeswehr. There was hardly any money left for new weapons. The armaments companies did not get any more orders and had to reduce capacities. Tanks like the Leopard 2 were no longer manufactured industrially, but in manufactory work. This takes longer and is more expensive. Sometimes two years passed between the production of the armored steel and the handing over of the vehicle to the customer. But the customers were in no hurry, peace reigned. And tanks seemed to be a military obsolescence anyway. Everyone was talking about cyber and drone warfare.Then came the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and suddenly not only the German Bundeswehr but also other Western armed forces realized that they had reduced their capacities too much. If they are to hand over their battle tanks, which are too few anyway, to the Ukraine, they will need replacements. Not at some point until the German tank industry can deliver, but immediately. Nobody wants to stand there bare, as the German army inspector complained about the Bundeswehr when war broke out on February 24, 2022.The German tank industry has an excellent reputation abroad. With the Leopard 2, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall have built the best tank in the world, but also one of the most expensive (7 to 8 million euros in the 2A7 version). In NATO and the EU alone, there are sixteen countries that have bought the Leopard 2. Some have several hundred pieces, such as Turkey, Greece, Spain, Poland and Finland. Others have fifty or fewer, such as Norway, Denmark and Canada."

      "body": "Arms deliveries as an instrument of security policy\n\n>Choosing a tank model is a long-term commitment. The education and training of the soldiers, the infrastructure for maintenance and repairs, the supply of spare parts - none of this can be switched from one tank type to another overnight. Once you're in business, you stay for decades. Conversely, once you're out of business, you stay out for a long time.It's not just an economic loss. The sale of arms secures taxes and jobs for the state and returns for companies. Above all, however, arms exports are part of foreign and security policy. Anyone who supplies another state with what it equips its own armed forces creates trust and at the same time economic dependence \u2013 and thus gains influence.For example, a submarine with a damaged propeller can only be returned to service if the manufacturer supplies a new propeller. In this way, the producing country can directly influence the combat capability of the customer state. In Germany, however, armaments exports were not viewed from this perspective for decades, but from an economic and above all from an ethical point of view. Politicians, especially from the left spectrum, wanted no more arms to be exported from Germany. They were convinced that this would make the world more peaceful.The Americans have a different policy. France felt the effects two years ago when Australia canceled a contract worth 56 billion euros to build submarines in order to buy American boats. The US government had previously signed a security alliance with the Australian government and Great Britain, which promised the Australians the support of the United States. In return, the Australians should buy their weapons in the United States."

      "body": "Americans play the trust card\n\n>From circles in the German armaments industry, it is said that the US government has been trying for years to intensify its arms sales in Europe. The deal seems to be good for both sides, American weapons are also among the best in the world. But trade also has its price. In January 2022, the Americans agreed with Croatia to deliver 89 used Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, including 22 as spare parts donors. The selling price was 130 million euros minus 46 million euros, which the US Department of Defense took over. But what initially sounded like a bargain turned out to be an expensive undertaking. The Bradleys are more than thirty years old. Croatia had to buy a total package including spare parts, servicing and maintenance. Total volume: 630 million euros.Developments in Poland are particularly painful for the German tank industry. In the past twenty years, the country has bought more than 200 Leopard 2 in Germany. After the Russian annexation of Crimea, German-Polish relations deteriorated. The government in Warsaw accused Berlin of taking a much too uncritical policy towards Moscow. Germany was seen by Poland as an increasingly insecure cantonist, even when it came to buying weapons. In July 2021, Defense Minister Mariusz Blazczak announced that he would buy 250 new and 116 used M1 Abrams main battle tanks in the USA at a total price of 8.85 billion euros. In the summer of last year, Poland also agreed to buy 1,000 K-2 battle tanks in South Korea. The manufacturer will set up a plant in Poland for this purpose. German industry had also applied for the order, but got nothing.Poland is now buying tanks from the US and South Korea. This is also politically painful for Germany, because one thing has become clear with the Polish decisions: Germany, the neighbor, is no longer a strategic, trustworthy partner. That's now the faraway United States and even farther away South Korea.Defense contractors, who wished to remain anonymous, say the Americans are offering used tanks as replacements from their own stocks and a long-term industrial partnership to countries that could supply the Leopard 2 to Ukraine. Any country that responds to the American offer can hardly be won back for the German tank industry. In addition, Berlin's influence on armaments policy is also declining."

The defense industry in Germany must also ask itself whether it should not have significantly increased its capacities again long ago. The growing need not only of Ukraine, but also of the western states for battle tanks has been obvious since February 24, 2022 at the latest. For the first time in decades, demand for weapons is booming in the West, but German manufacturers can hardly deliver.The US, meanwhile, is already counting what arms sales to European allies could bring in to replace their supplies to Ukraine. The Center on Military and Political Power of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, an apparently Israeli-funded Washington lobbying organization, recently reported that a total of $21.7 billion could be expected, regardless of whether it is are used or brand new weapons.A few days ago, Olaf Scholz complained that in view of the small numbers produced by the German armaments companies, one could not speak of \"a real industry\". He called for the production of weapons and ammunition to be expanded significantly. On Saturday, SPD party leader Lars Klingbeil proposed a \"pact with the armaments industry\".Both statements show once again that there is no lack of knowledge in German security policy, but rather a lack of implementation. The question remains as to why this pact hasn't existed for a long time after almost a year of the Ukraine war with industry."

Winner of BdO: Lionel Messi, despite the fact many of his Barcelona teammates shared all his club results AND won the World Cup on top of that.

Winner of BdO: Fabio Cannavaro, Italy, Juventus.  That's how far back you have to go, and Cannavaro wasn't just handed that award because of the WC, he had won Serie A footballer of the year (and also Serie A defender the year before).  He was a top contender at club level for whom the WC probably pushed him over the edge.  Moreover, this was two decades ago, and the focus has since shifted more heavily to UCL goal counts, mostly because it was necessary to justify handing Ronaldo BdOs when Messi was by far the best player in the world."

Ronaldo didn't even have that bad of a WC, I think he scored a hattrick against Spain that summer. Still lost to Luka. \n\nThat helps my point that the WC is the difference maker as Luka didn't even win the final.

Os primeiros a fazerem um projeto mais organizado s\u00e3o exatamente o Palmeiras e o Flamengo.\n\nAgora todo ano saem bons jogadores das categorias de jovens desses dois clubes, diminuindo assim a necessidade de contratar jogadores de outros pa\u00edses.\n\nO Palmeiras s\u00f3 vai negociar o Merentiel e o Flaco Lopez porque aposta que o Endrick (jovem revelado pelo clube) e o Rony (um extremo que atuou v\u00e1rias vezes de falso 9 com o Abel) podem ser suficientes num primeiro momento na posi\u00e7\u00e3o. Al\u00e9m disso, devem utilizar os extremos Giovani e o Kevin, ambos revelados pelo clube, no time principal...

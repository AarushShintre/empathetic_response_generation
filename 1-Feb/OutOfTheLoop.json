Mutating a virus into more deadly form, for whatever purpose, *is* the same as the generally accepted definition of *gain of function\u201d regarding research on viral loads. If you disagree with that, then there we go. If you want to be willfully obtuse about common sense and facts. I refuse to carry on here. I did not lie. You tried to twist my statements into one. \n\nI admit you will no longer find info on that man using google today. Had you done it when the news broke? Yeah you would have. A director of Research for Pfizer has no Google presence(Jordan Walker, btw)? Yeah, ok. That\u2019s believable. Since then and within the 48 hours between Project veritas\u2019 video was released and Pfizer\u2019s statement was released everything got scrubbed by google, YouTube, and all of the other controlled outlets. \n\nAlso Pfizer admitted that they are required by \u201cthe regulators\u201d to do these type of \u201cnot-calling-it-gain-of-function\u201d and to do them \u201cin secret\u201d.

It would almost seem that the video is not legitimate and that that person is in fact not a Pfizer executive.\n\nBut since we don't have the data on that definitively yet, we should withhold judgment.\n\nInstead of withholding judgment, you are recklessly twisting the facts and connecting plot points with assumptions.\n\nYour buzzwords and unanswered questions based on assumptions you're slinging must sound fun to you, but destroy your argumentative credibility and have no bearing on gain of function research, antiviral research, or newsworthy breakthroughs. \n\nYou have nothing new to add to the conversation, so instead of adding to the conversation, you're ripping apart the conversation into tiny flutters of ideas, removing the context, and then tying those disconnected ideas together with assumptions.\n\nMade up and unfounded answers might help you with your insecurity, but you're just pulling the wool over your own eyes."

God is a singular monotheistic God, but also a Father separate from His Son and A Spirit who is also separate and distinct. \n\nIn Mark 13:32 Jesus says that only the father knows when The time for Jesus to return in judgment will be, stating specifically that He himself doesn\u2019t know the time.

For example, when America started destroying black neighborhoods, building highways through their neighborhoods, and ensuring they'd be jobless in the 1960s, crime rates soared then and not before. His theory of gang culture arising from rednecks is equally silly too, treating it as memetic identity as if one wears it like a uniform.\n\nThe Hoover institute keeps this 95 year old man around because he's a useful tool to 'soften' slavery among Evangelical conservatives of which Sowell himself is one."

There have definitely been people working for equality all throughout history, but as an overall social movement that really made changes in the western world it really took off and gained traction in the 19th century. The suffragettes fighting for political influence and the right to vote (and helping with working towards abolition,) the right to higher education, and the right to individual autonomy/property ownership and divorce. Once they achieved those things it kind of fizzled out for a while until the next wave when women started fighting for the rights to individualism and sexual autonomy, reproductive rights (even the pill was a battle, not even touching abortion,) workplace rights (sexual harassment, equal opportunities,) along with home life issues like spousal rape, abuse, and further into the issues of divorce and custody. \n\nThere have also been a third and fourth wave since then, third was the \"Girl power\" 90s era, fighting for recognition as strong, independent, and perfectly capable members of society without needing to conform to the patriarchy's standards and expectations of women. Lots of freedom of expression, celebrating femininity and womanhood, and openness about sexuality. This is where the pundits draw their caricatures of the raging man-hating lesbian feminist with purple hair and combat boots. (Not that that was the whole or even majority, but as always, the most extreme example is the one to use to vilify the whole. And fuck it, sis, rock that purple hair.)\n\nThe fourth is where we are now, starting in the 2010s with speaking out about sexual abuse and objectification (think #MeToo - even though people have individually spoken up about abuse and harassment in the past, #MeToo was a WAVE that took over the social conversation for quite a while and saw many people talking openly about these things that they had been scared or ashamed to speak about as individuals before.) There's also a push for overall gender equality, not just for women to be equal to men, but to remove the expectations of gender roles in general - men should be able to care for their children without being asked if they're babysitting. Boys should be able to play with dolls or be told that it's okay to cry and talk about their feelings. Women can be the breadwinner for a perfectly happy and healthy nuclear family, etc."

I think part of it is so many marginalized groups starting to work together instead of individually in the past. It's not just black people fighting for black rights and women fighting for women's rights and gay people fighting for gay rights etc. The social movement now is more of a mesh of all of it, and working together we're stronger and have a better chance of gaining equality for all. Unfortunately there have always been people who benefit from being above others, and they continue to teach their children that they're better than others.  It wasn't all that long ago that women were considered property of their husbands, black people were *literally* property to be sold, and gay people were beaten and murdered for existing. We've made a lot of progress, but there is still a long way to go and a lot of people upset about every step forward."

There's always some sort of social hierarchy, based on gender, race, capability, wealth, or just being born in the right family. Religion plays a strong part in cementing those ranks in most cultures, but even as hunter/gatherers I'm sure there were situations where the best hunter was more valued than the weakling, and tribal cultures tend to have some sort of leadership, either a chief kind of figure or a spiritual leader. Once people have a footing they just keep widening the gap. Once some cultures started advancing further than others they started conquering and enslaving them, or at least seeing them as lesser humans while they colonized their land. Women have always been considered weaker and therefore less useful. Their place is to have babies and take care of their husband. There have been some cultures where women were equal or even elevated, but not many.\n\nIt's just a facet of nature - even animal groups have hierarchies and social structures. We're self-aware enough that we can realize it's bullshit and move past it, but there have always been people who like having people under them."

Again, other companies are doing this the proper way and testing with highly trained individuals to work out these kinks but Tesla is just offering as an add on so that you can pay to be the tester and assume liability. You and all the other testers are t highly trained and I am an unwilling participant in this test the minute that you turn FSD on and get on a public road. \n\nYes there are disclosures saying you must keep your hands on the wheel at all times and you must be fully focused on the road, but this is be marketed as fully autonomous and being safer than an average driver. I don\u2019t trust you and the average driver to use the level of caution that testing a software like this requires, the level of caution that the highly trained engineers at other companies are using. \n\nSo yeah bottom line is I\u2019m not comfortable with this being available on a public road way nation wide.

If out of courtesy he consents for a moment to defend his point of view, he lends himself but does not give himself...\n\n\n>\u201cNever believe that anti\u2010Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly since he believes in words. The anti\u2010Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument has passed.\u201d"

South germany were quite affected because of the tschernobyl fallout.\n\nIf Merkel was so affected by the green propaganda she had the choice to make the change in the way the greens did plan it, she didnt. She closed nuclear and bailed them all out with millions of euros while cripling renewables and other new tech. She did non plan a new energy system or invest in infrastructe or anything else. She did promote NS2, even when the greens were against it, russia did attack georgia and russia did attack ukraine and you wanna paint the greens for that and thats just not true.\n\nYour said the greens are paid russian shills and they did everthing to ensure that we get more and more russian gas. You cant backup anything what you said. I gave you some action like voting against ns2 and more integration with russia and boost renewables .\n\nWhat for actions they else gonna do, they were in opposition most of the time until last year, and when they got in power all their action was all against russia and is now.\n\nThey want more weapons against russia from the beginning, even if thats against their stance they promoted before the attack and they build lng terminals even if they didnt want more gas and were against ns2. On top they were against label the russian gas green.\n\nWhere are your arguments other than \"merkel had no choice because green propaganda paid by russia\" Bring me something specific what the green party pushed so hard that was pro russia, if your only argument is that they dont like nuclear thats another discussion.\n\nIn germany only right wing afd tries to promote nuclear, they are against supporting ukraine and were invited to moscow in the past, so wheres your correlation?"

Young Thug is the main target, and faces charges of murder, witness intimidation, firearm charges and possibly more, and so he is facing life behind bars.\n\nMany other YSL artists and alleged gang members were detained as part of the RICO case, including Gunna. However, Gunna has been freed after taking a plea deal and agreeing to testify should the need arise. He has also adversely affected Young Thugs defense by admitting YSL is in fact, also a criminal gang."

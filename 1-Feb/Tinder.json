I am approximately 130 lbs but I haven\u2019t weighed myself in a while because I don\u2019t really care. I have long red hair and my bra is a 34b. I have a larger forehead than I\u2019d like, but I also have big doe eyes that I think kind of make up for it so I don\u2019t worry about it like I used to in 7th grade. My ass is flat but I\u2019ve got a sort of skinny hourglass figure and my legs are too long for my body. I dress mostly in big wool sweaters and mini skirts with tights with satin bows tying my hair up. But I\u2019m also a filthy slob when I\u2019m at home most of the time. Duality of man and such shit. I\u2019m half tempted to show you a screenshot of my tinder to prove it, but I made this burner account specifically because too many people on this sub have zero concept of boundaries and I don\u2019t want someone reverse image searching my pics and finding me and trying to ruin my life for being a feminist on Reddit. But I have no reason to lie. And while this could potentially be a nice meet cute in another universe, I couldn\u2019t ever go further in chatting or flirting with you because, while I may personally not be overweight, I have people whom I dearly love who ARE overweight. Or who are lates 30s cat ladies. Or who have a visible disability. And I have talked with them about their struggles and how much it hurts to see people use their body type or circumstance or disability as an insult, even if they\u2019re trying to be funny. So out of solidarity to them, I would kick your ass to the curb for this behavior no matter how we clicked or if I found you heartstoppingly attractive. \n\nThank you for your kind words and, next time, try skipping straight to the banter and candor and skip the other, more insulting, parts. Cheers and have a good life."

While I find the idea bonkers, I can totally see why it would be appealing to some. You get to have relationships, but not get tied down to one person. And if what both of you are wanting. You both win. That exists.\n\nHowever. I just put two and two together and realized \"short-term\" is short term for \"short-term \\*fun\\*\".  Aka hook up. Which sounds a LOT more mainstream and now I see why its a common tag. I was confused on how such a wacky idea was on all these dating apps when \"I really want a long term relationship, but give im single and ill take what I can get im open to hook ups too\" felt like it would be something people would use a lot more.\n\nTurns out I was right..... about thinking the thing I was wrong about didn't make sense.

Assuming the order of two statements defines their importance is a big logical fallacy. There is an actual English reason you would use open and looking in that phrase instead of just looking.  \"looking for short, looking for long\" sounds dumb and doesn't flow like \"looking for short, and open to long\". Its repetitive. There is an actual reason looking for, and open to, would have exactly the same magnitude. It just simply sounds better that way. In the court of law, you'd be laughed out of the room over that implication.\n\nHOWEVER. Human behavior isn't logical and is always breaking logical reasoning. And I do believe you.\n\nIts one of those ways people have mind reading capabilities that me (and most other people on the spectrum) just don't have. And its REALLY annoying when people apply that to me and I don't know it exists.\n\nI have been very frustrated because I ordered it \"looking for hook-ups, open to long\". Just because going least important to important makes sense to me. You remember that last thing someone says more than the first. Logically the order is arbitrary anyway. And the phrase \"looking for\" always precedes \"open to\" in those statements. So I kept them in the same order as everyone else just because. I would write an entire paragraph on how I was far far more serious about the relationship than hookups to try and clear up this misunderstanding. And people didn't fucking care. And seemingly just decided my own intentions for me against my word.\n\nTo me this just felt \"man like sex = bad man\". Which is super sexist and very accepted in many parts of society rn. So I had no reason to think otherwise.\n\nBut. In reality they were trying to read my mind as if it functioned like a normal person. Weren't they?

As it happens, I grew up in a hunting/fishing family, and went on to get  a degree in natural resources and public lands, and have been around this stuff for almost four decades since.  I cheer for women (and kids) getting into ethical hunting/fishing in the Aldo Leopold tradition.  But I also understand demographics and math.   To this day, its a white (Euro-descent) male dominated thing, and ..... feel free to disagree..... if you took the macho vibe out of hunting in the year 2022, only about 10% - maybe - would have engaged in the activity.    .............   Those rebuttals aside, you imply everyone owes a debt of gratitude to hunters/fishers for the amount of state and federal public lands that have been set aside in the US, and I couldn't agree more.   I'd absolutely LOVE to take all my left leaning pro gun control friends to a range and teach them to shoot responsibly and safely so they have that lived experience to inform them when they talk about hunting and gun control.

You can say/think that his joke was shitty and not funny all you want but humor is subjective. Making a joke about someone's weight doesn't necessarily mean you hate fat people or are an asshole. But it seems like we disagree about it and you either way are not open for dialogue since you \"don't care if I agree or not\" and you \"don't want me to tell you that you're jumping to conclusions\" great trait and discourse!   \n\n\nAbout the edit: saying 12 other people downvoted it so that must mean you're right doesn't mean shit. Unless you wanna tell me that you **actually** believe that if the majority says something is x then that thing is indeed x just because of your side being the majority? Cause I can give you a lot of countries where the majority does atrocities and believe they're to be right but that still doesn't make it okay. To give you a radical example (that's often how examples work): people believed slavery was fine but that still didn't make it okay. Same with women's rights that were non-existent.   \n\n\nAnd yes, you are jumping to conclusions. You can do whatever the fuck you want to do. But if you think he is bullshiting then don't reply. If you take the role of a nice person, then you can definitely give him the benefit of the doubt and believe him. But you didn't.   \n\n\nAnyway, being an asshole to someone who is potentially an asshole (but might not be in that circumstance) still makes you an asshole. Stand by your standards."

If I freaked out every time she didn't respond to me for a while, our relationship would've ended a while ago.\n\nEdit: To clarify, I do agree that if you feel someone is important you should want a relatively prompt response from them.

It\u2019s never like I can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t message in five minutes or it took him 4 hours to reply. I mean like a full day or more no contact. But as I said a quick message in the morning isn\u2019t hard, and I\u2019m the type of person that when I\u2019m really about someone I will message them every morning when I wake up and every night before bed and I\u2019d like someone who\u2019s like me in that way.

I was just saying I try to be as open as possible to someone's schedule, and try not to assume their being rude just because they haven't answered. You're right, a quick message isn't difficult... but sometimes someone is just running late, or isn't feeling well, or maybe just had a bad day and doesn't want to look at their phone. I really am trying to see it from both sides here, and you make excellent arguments (especially because I'm pretty sure my SO and I haven't actually gone a full day without checking in since we started dating).

Once something is established then yes I completely agree that our relationship should be able to withstand not being in contact all the time but at that point you most likely have a system, check in at night before bed or whatever it may be. Like I don\u2019t see how someone you\u2019re serious about could go the whole day without at least just saying \u201chey I\u2019m okay and we\u2019ll talk later/tomorrow/etc.\u201d or having a quick check in with other to make sure you\u2019re both good."

Lagging when making plans or plans have already been made is an even bigger pet peeve of mine. Like why are you gonna waste my time like that? If something comes up let me know in a decent time. I won\u2019t blow up on you for not texting back but if we had plans you lag and then stand me up on those plans with no explanation until after said plans were supposed happen I\u2019m gonna be sassy and probably never text back again.

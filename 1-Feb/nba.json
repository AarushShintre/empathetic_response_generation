So to get a triple double you need to reach double digits in 3 different stats in a single game. Last year Jokic averaged 13.8 rebounds per game good for a 23% rebounding rate, in Russ\u2019 MVP season he averaged 10.7 per game for a 17.1% rebounding rate. This isn\u2019t the 10-10 comparison you asked for but I\u2019m not a big enough stat nerd to know how to find what quantifies the quality of rebounds, one way is uncontested rebounds, do they just get what bounces their way or are they getting those 50/50 balls. Quality of rebounds is important because uncontested rebounds are something that the average rebounder will get, great rebounds steal extra possessions for their team. This is somewhere that Russ beat Jokic comparing MVP years, Russ had an offensive rebound rate of 5.4% compared to 2.8% in both of Jokic\u2019 MVP seasons. I can explain why making more of your shots and having fewer turnovers is a positive if you\u2019re still confused."

Or you at least put them away with 2 minutes to go. If you allow the game to get down to one possession, you can't control the game. Someone can make a miracle shot or your star could turn it over or the refs can 100% decide the game. The goal should always be to take that power away. Win games decisively and none of this matters.

If you know someone that plays blackjack, they typically get mad when a bad player sits next to them. Because they'll notice when that bad player hits or doesn't hit when they should or shouldn't. And then they get the bad card. So they blame that bad player. Completely ignoring that there's no statistical difference.

When he\u2019s had spacing he\u2019s absolutely shown that he can put up that kind of numbers on a playoff roster.

You\u2019re not going to convince many people that Lillard could have had a top 20 all time resume just by swapping him with Steph because you\u2019re making it up. You have no idea and you\u2019re just assuming that if Dame goes there they can run the same system and will have the same defense. Why, if it took all of Steph Curry\u2019s excellence to win the finals, would Dame who is worse at pretty much everything and way worse at some things be able to do it. It\u2019s a crazy take because even if it is technically possible we have literally never seen it. Lillards best playoffs outside of the 6 game one in 2020 is on par or worse than Curry\u2019s average playoffs. Love Dame, but he\u2019s just nowhere close to Steph and you need a top-5 player to win in this NBA which Dame is not. When was the last finals where a team\u2019s best player was only as good or worse than Lillard?"

This entire conversation is just speculation. \n\nI don\u2019t think Dame wins in 15-16 but if we are talking about 16-17 or 17-18 absolutely I can see him winning with that squad. Same with 21-22. Anyone who thought that team was mediocre doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, it was one of the more favoured Vegas teams if I recall correctly. \n\nI think you\u2019re overrating Currys individual defence personally. He\u2019s not a liability whatsoever but he\u2019s literally in one of the best defensive schemes year in year out. You\u2019re acting like it was some major long shot that the Warriors were a title team. You were able to play Poole less because of how deep your team was. \n\nBecause I\u2019ve seen how he\u2019s played with rosters with better spacing. Dame has consistently played well since 2019 in the playoffs. He had poor series against Denver and Warriors. But against LA he was a constant threat and creating so much space, we had no business even being a playoff team. He almost willed us single handedly over the Nuggets the next season. As soon as we got rid of Harkless and Aminu teams couldn\u2019t afford to just double team him and leave others open all the time.\n\nAre you meaning a winning team? Because Booker and Tatum were the best players on finals teams. Jimmy Butler was the best player on the Heat. None of these players have been top 5 players."

And I agree it requires some speculation that Steph would do better than Dame, it\u2019s just an easier assumption to make because Steph is better than Dame. I agreed he wins with the KD Warriors, Dame is a baller and those teams are best in the league, although maybe they lose 2018 to the Rockets. To be clear about defense, I don\u2019t think Curry is some great defender, but I do believe he is very noticeably better than Dame and that would be clear if they swapped places. At the end of the day I think my strongest argument is my last one though. The best player on the championship teams going back through time would be Steph, Giannis, LeBron, Kawhi, KD/Steph back to back, LeBron, Steph, Kawhi, LeBron, LeBron, Dirk, Kobe, Kobe, Paul Pierce, Tim Duncan, Wade, Duncan, Billups. The outlier 2004 Pistons are the last team to have a worse player than Lillard win the Finals. Maybe you could argue the first Kawhi year, I think that\u2019s fair but probably unique because that Spurs team was way more loaded than the Warriors last year anyway. Regardless I think you are underestimating how good you need to be to win the Finals as the best player, Lillard is great but he\u2019s not that level of great."

He\u2019s undoubtedly a poor defender, but it\u2019s not that big of a deal at the PG position as the wing positions or as a big where it\u2019s basically a must have skill to defend well to win. \n\nI think you are being a bit unfair if you are going to put Paul Pierce, the 14 point average role player Kawhi over him like that. Dirk Nowitziki in 2011 wasn\u2019t doing anything more than Dame is now. All of these players you named have had substantially better rosters than Dame ever has had as well. \n\n Booker, Tatum and Butler were all that close to winning a title though. Bucks didn\u2019t just win because of Giannis, he had a great team. Warriors didn\u2019t just win because of Curry being better, he also had a great team. I don\u2019t buy that a top 10 player can\u2019t be the best player on a title winning team. It\u2019s just that superstars almost always attract the talent. Players like Curry and LeBron get so many decent role players to sign on prove it deals or had the luxury of playing with all time talent."

In terms of Lillard\u2019s impact you are simply overrating him. He\u2019s efficient but certainly not historically so (his best season\u2019s TS% is equal to Curry\u2019s average season). I\u2019ll admit he would be looked at much better if Curry didn\u2019t exist because he would be the 3 point guy. Either way if you\u2019re sticking with Dame to the point you are saying he is as good as 2011 Dirk who had one of the most impressive playoff runs of all time I don\u2019t know how to argue with you. You don\u2019t seem to deny Curry is significantly better than Dame, yet you think these playoffs where a Curry-led Warriors barely won would go the same way if Dame was in his place. It doesn\u2019t make much sense to me but maybe Dame will pop off this playoffs and make me look silly."

That\u2019s good for 61.8% TS even including last years terrible season he had, and he had a terrible stretch this season. His current form is absolutely up there all time with all the scorers. \n\nEven if we go back to when Dame started being the lead option in 15-16. He\u2019s averaged 27.2, 4.4 and 7 on 44, 37 and 90% which is still basically at 59.6% TS. Like you are comparing him to a complete anomaly of a player. Career wise he\u2019s still 57th in TS%, not bad for someone who is usually thought of as a streaky player. \n\nHe absolutely would if Curry didn\u2019t exist , but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Curry is pushing for a top 10 spot eventually. Dame doesn\u2019t have the accolades yet, or never will to be anywhere near that. But he\u2019s still been better than every other guard this era besides Harden in my opinion, who is another historic player. \n\nBro stop with the Curry led Warriors \u201cbarely won\u201d. The west was a complete cakewalk for you. You 4-1 the Nuggets and Mavericks? You absolutely had a great team last season and that\u2019s okay. \n\nJust like how when Curry was putting up insane numbers the season before that and arguably having his best season since 15-16 y\u2019all only came in 8th. Like give Curry his dues but it\u2019s not all him. The Warriors had an amazing scheme last season."

My overall point isn\u2019t about their performances in the finals Bud. My point is emphasize that \u201cneither has a ring\u201d is such a weak write off when Tatum has consistently proven he can take his team further than Embiid can take his. Sure neither one has a ring, Tatum still has beaten teams Embiid hasn\u2019t, whilst playing later than Embiid has.

I do agree that their are multiple ways to hold Refs accountable but giving them worse assignments/less assignments AREN\u2019T going to do anything lmao. And you continue to fail to understand that fining refs is only ONE of the ways that I suggested to improve officiating. Implementing real time replay reviews is the first major step. Handing out legitimate consequences like small fines is a good start and then handing out 1 game suspensions if the refs continue to be fined for multiple months. This will actually incentivize the Refs to improve at their job. You think a Ref would want to continuously be known for bad officiating when the entire world can CLEARLY see those fines? And where did I say coaches get fined for mistakes? Seriously go back and reread lmao. I said if coaches can get fined for ticky tack techs, then a ref should be able to get fined for continuous bad officiating. How is it that the Refs are the only people on the court that are untouchable from fines in a competitive nationally televised sport? Players getting less minutes almost ALWAYS lead to less motivation. Why do you think players like Reddish are struggling? LESS PLAYING TIME. He\u2019s often in and out of rotations. Rarely do players improve from less playing time unless they still get minutes which is nothing like completely removing that Ref from an assignment. Again worse assignments = they still get paid. Less assignments = No pay which gives them a motivation to quit because their not earning any money from their job.\n\nAnd yes we SHOULD reward good officials. But those bad officials NEED to be held accountable and dished out legitimate consequences. The way a ref should receive a fine is if they are the ones to blow the whistle and raise their hand on a STRING of BLATANT horrible calls within a month. If you\u2019re a referee with the benefit of replay review and you CONTINUE to have horrible calls, they NEED to have a consequence. And it\u2019s not a fine for EVERY bad call which you seem to think I\u2019m implying but rather a stretch of bad calls within the month. \n \nOf course it\u2019s not complicated at all. Giving Refs a legitimate consequence will help them improve on their ways. That\u2019s why you see less of those actions that get you fined in the NBA like flopping or speaking out on officials."

He stretches the floor, gives him space in the paint to drive, is a 3 level scorer that is an improved passer. Does it win a championship? No, probably not. But I do think it makes us better than we would be without KAT even if we tried to build through the draft.

I just don\u2019t understand what the GM thought when he made that move & gave up so much to get him. The move put KAT out of position since he\u2019s really a stretch 5 that can play back to the basket if he wants (I think he should be doing it a bit more). McDaniels was the perfect 4 alongside the 2 of em (Ant & Kat) bc he\u2019s a great defender as well as a floor spacer. While I don\u2019t think DLo is the right fit at starting PG, if you still had the draft capital and hadn\u2019t made the trade for Gobert, I\u2019d have seriously considered giving 2 1sts to Toronto for OG. A starting 5 of DLo, Ant, OG, McDaniels, and Kat at the 5 would\u2019ve been SOLID. And if DLo would buy into coming off the bench and you started a 3 & D pass first PG alongside Ant in the backcourt, your team would have had tremendous offense and defensive balance bc 4 guys on your team can defend, 2 of them defend at an elite level\u2026I\u2019d have given that roster a good chance of coming out of the West"

I don\u2019t think he necessarily gets a contract extension so there\u2019s a good chance we could lose him for nothing. It might have made sense originally in the Gobert trade to send Dlo to Utah, and retain Malik and Beasley but the wolves are in a weird spot where they don\u2019t have a ton of great options. Personally, I wouldnt hate OG, but that\u2019s a pretty complicated trade to pull off before the deadline and we\u2019d still be stuck with an aging center that cant shoot or be effective in the playoffs on a massive contract while the rest of our team enter their prime. I think we just have to stick to the original vision, see how it works, and then blow it up again if need be"

You keep shifting / making assumptions about what I\u2019m saying.

When Bam Adebayo is on the court, the Miami Heat operate at what would be the best defensive rating in the league, per CTG.\n\nWhen he's off, they are 10 points worse per 100 possessions.\n\nThe starting lineup of Kyle Lowry, Tyler Herro, Jimmy Butler, Caleb Martin, Bam Adebayo is the #1 defensive lineup in the NBA with 200+ minutes by the stats, at 103.7.\n\nBam has actually played all year with a starting back court of washed Kyle Lowry and Tyler Herro, his backup being Dewayne dedmon, maybe the worst player in the league. We have started Max Strus at PF in the double digits. Our second best defender with nobody else even being close in Jimmy Butler has played just 35 games\n\nUnfortunately Bam doesn't get enough steals and blocks though so he'll never win, and no, that's not a reference to JJJs blocks or steals being illegitimate, they are legitimate, Bam just doesn't pad the stat sheet or play as a traditional rim protector.\n\n\nJaren Jackson Jr turned a bad defense into an elite one? Bam has been doing that all damn year too."

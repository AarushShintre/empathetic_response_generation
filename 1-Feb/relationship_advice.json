Do you see a future together where you can both thrive? This is your first relationship, so maybe he knows you need some more maturity and life experience before becoming more serious. Some relationships you never say I love you, and that is okay when it's part of the journey."

      "body": "You know we can and do fall in love with multiple people. It doesn\u2019t mean the relationship is solid or healthy. It\u2019s just that chemical feeling that is quite overwhelming. I don\u2019t think it sounds like something is seriously wrong by not saying it after 6 months. And if you feel cared for and prioritised then he is showing you how he feels and in most ways that\u2019s more important then the words. People say (and mean) I love you and yet treat their partners like shit.\n\nMy biggest concern here is the age gap. A lot of women in their late 20s or early 30s are looking for something serious or potentially serious. \n\nMen who are 30 usually date early 20s because they are inexperienced, easy to manipulate and put up with a lot of bs an older more experienced woman wouldn\u2019t. Also because they assume young women just want to have fun and not put pressure on them to commit. I\u2019m 35, a 22 year old is very very young to me. To the point of not being attractive. No one I know who is my age has dated someone so young bc quite frankly we all think it\u2019s creepy as hell. There are exceptions to every rule but my personal advice is - idc if he\u2019s said it or not he\u2019s creepy and go find love with someone your own age"

I have in my extended family Iranians, Chinese, Indian, western/Northern European and Australians. I have never heard not saying I love you is normal. Between parents and children yes it can be very sparse. But between partners hell no."

They were relationships that taught me lessons before I met my now fiance (and we say I love you all the time). OP's first relationship shouldn't necessarily be her only relationship. It's okay to learn some lessons and bring them with you to your next relationship."

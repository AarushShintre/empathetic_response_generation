Children with bad cases of rickets grow up into adults with reduced ability to farm, hunt, or gather foods, who are at increased risk of starvation, less fertile because of worse nutrition, and less desirable as mates.

The problem is, there ***are*** evolutionary influences affecting the genes of the global population. For instance, going back to nut allergies, modern medicine and food production means that having a nut allergy is not nearly as likely to lead to premature death as it once was. This is an evolutionary influence. Also, you even just mentioned that there are areas in the world with differing numbers of people who have nut allergies. That by itself suggests that the gene flow across the entire human population is not in equilibrium and thus there are influences affecting how genes are propagated.\n\nAll that to say, the HW principle doesn't apply here and therefore it ***is*** possible that the number of people with nut allergies could be growing or shrinking."

Or whatever else you want to run on an isolated network, but using your infrastructure, that might not need routing to every switch, every remote location, every building, etc.\n\nThere will be buildings that, for example, don't need a camera.  So you wouldn't bother to make the CCTV VLAN route over to that switch.  Hence it will have a different topology for that VLAN versus your wider network.  There will be an isolated server-based VLAN that only runs between your servers, and not every cabinet will host a server, or need to communicate on that VLAN.  Or maybe some legacy buildings/switches don't support VLANs.  Or maybe some of the links are not normal network links but microwave point-to-point links, or WAN links or VPN links, so you don't want the bulk-video CCTV traffic trying to use them.\n\nVLANs are there to isolate a particular system (e.g. telephony) so you can treat it differently, (apply QoS settings to it) or separate it from the normal network (e.g. because those ports are public and you don't want anyone to just plug into your network, or because you want to isolate backend servers that users never directly contact from the CCTV cameras, for example).\n\nSo, yes, VLANs entire purpose is to be configured for different purposes, but using your same infrastructure (you don't want to have to run entirely separate switches, cabling, routers and fibre just for a camera system, but equally you don't want anyone to be able to unplug a camera and plug in their laptop to access the internet)."

It tries to find the best route, and if you have it per-VLAN then it takes account that there are places where it can't use certain routes for that particular section of traffic.\n\nHow it does that isn't really designed to \"load-balance\" anything at all.  It just happens to find the best available route for that VLAN (which may not be the same as the best available route for everything else that passes over the network).  But you can make it so that, say, the VLANs for CCTV steer traffic away from other core areas of your network if you design the network correctly.

      "body": "As you probably know, electrons in isolated atoms or in molecules fit into slots called *orbitals*. For example, the *2p* orbitals of a regular oxygen atom contain four electrons, occupying four of those orbitals' six available \"slots\". Similarly, the *2s* orbital of that same oxygen atom contains two electrons, occupying both of that orbitals available slots, and the *3s* orbital of that oxygen contains no electrons (but it has two spots available for one).\n\nZooming in a bit, each orbitals set's slots come from two factors:\n\n* How many orbitals of that type there are. There is 1 *s* orbital, 3 *p* orbitals, 5 *d* orbitals, 7 *f* orbitals, etc. at each level of energy.\n* The fact that an electron can be spin-up or spin-down, which allows 2 electrons to occupy each orbital.\n\nThat's *why* you can have 2 electrons per *s* energy level: there's 1 s orbital and it can hold 2 electrons. Similarly, you can have 6 electrons per p energy level: there are 3 p orbitals and each can hold 2 electrons.\n\n-----\n\nOrbitals are filled up in order of increasing energy. That part is easy enough. But the relevant part here is that *within each energy level*, orbitals [fill up in a certain way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hund%27s_rule_of_maximum_multiplicity). Specifically:\n\n* Electrons fill different orbitals before they fill the same one, and\n* Electrons try to align their spins as much as possible.\n\nSo in oxygen, for example, we have three available *p* orbitals, and we need to put four electrons in them. If we add electrons one by one, they'll take the following order, where I'll write <Up, down, empty> to mean \"the first p has an up electron, the second has a down electron, and the third has none\".\n\n* <Up, empty, empty> or <Down, empty, empty>. Either works, but for the sake of argument, let's assume the first electron happens to be up.\n* <Up, up, empty>. The second electron occupies a different p orbital, and aligns its spin.\n* <Up, up, up>. The third electron occupies a different p orbital, and aligns its spin.\n* <Both, up, up>. The fourth electron has no different orbital to occupy, and is forced into pairing itself with another electron.\n\nThere's nothing physically preventing an oxygen atom from being in the state, say, <Both, up, down>. But it's unstable, because there's a lower-energy state available with the same number of electrons (namely, <Both, up, up> or <Both, down, down>). The same goes for, say, <Both, both, empty> (which has higher energy <Both, up, up> or <Both, down, down>). We call these kinds of states *excited states*: they have the same particles as a regular oxygen atom, but they have higher energy.\n\n-----\n\nIn a dioxygen *molecule*, things are a little different, but the principle is the same. Rather than the s, p, d, and f orbitals of isolated atoms, molecules form *molecular orbitals*, which end up having the same rules but somewhat more complicated energy levels. \n\nIn this case, the three p orbitals on one oxygen atom and the three p orbitals on the other end up converting into six molecular orbitals: one bonding sigma orbital, two bonding pi orbitals, two antibonding pi orbitals, and one antibonding sigma orbital, in order of increasing energy. (For the purposes of your question, you don't need to know what \"bonding\" and \"antibonding\" mean here, although if you're asking the question at all, you hopefully do know what these mean. All we need to know is that there are four available energy levels here.)\n\nSince there are four electrons from each oxygen involved, we fill these orbitals with eight electrons from the bottom:\n\n* The bonding sigma orbital gets filled with 2 electrons.\n* Each of the two bonding pi orbitals get filled with 2 electrons (for 4 total).\n* The remaining 2 electrons go into the antibonding pi orbitals, filling two of their available four slots.\n\nIt's the behavior of these last two electrons we're interested in.\n\nIn normal oxygen (*triplet* oxygen, in technical terms), we follow the usual rule, and the antibonding pi orbitals are in the state <up, up> or <down, down>, with the electrons divided between the two orbitals and in a state with aligned spins.\n\nSinglet oxygen, on the other hand, is an excited state with the electrons in the state <both, empty> or <empty, both>. This is higher energy than the <up, up> or <down, down> states of regular triplet oxygen, so singlet oxygen is a less stable molecule. Singlet oxygen will convert to triplet oxygen over time, though this process is rather slow.\n\nMore importantly, the higher energy of the electrons in this orbital weaken the bond in singlet oxygen substantially relative to the bond in triplet oxygen, and singlet oxygen is much more reactive as a result. Singlet oxygen also has some different properties from regular triplet oxygen, as well: in particular, triplet oxygen aligns with magnetic fields thanks to its unpaired electrons, while singlet oxygen does not."

      "body": ">No, socialism is when the means of production is owned by the people. So, for example, Amazon would be owned by it's workers, rather than Jeffery Bezos.\n\nEmployee owned companies aren't really an example of socialism, though the word \"socialism\" can mean a lot of things and often confuses people who use it interchangeably with \"communism.\"\n\nSocialism is when the government (*all* the people) own the means of production. But \"production\" can be a little confusing too because it wouldn't apply simply to manufacturing. A National Park would be socialistic in nature because it's technically owned by the people. Public utilities that provide both a product (clean water or energy) and a service (sewage removal) would also be \"socialism.\" Police and fire departments, public roads, schools, museums, etc., are all generally socialistic.\n\nSo be wary of people who start screaming about \"socialism\" because every country in the world is technically socialistic to some extent. If there's a government, clearly there are some elements of socialism mixed in with capitalism.\n\nCommunism, on the other hand, is when the government owns ALL means of production. All services, all manufacturers, all real property is owned by the government. You may have some personal property interests, however. There has never been an actual \"communist\" government. The soviets weren't fully communistic nor is China communistic, despite the fact that they call themselves communists. As soon as someone mentions a Chinese billionaire, that should be a red flag that it's not actual communism."

For people who don't understand something, it's easier and often more more effective to reference a single example that literally everybody knows about. \n\nPure capitalism is quite literally impossible to maintain on a national level, as are pure socialism, and communism.\n\n\nTo recap at a basic-ish level:\n\nmeans of production: any land, building, or property that generates wealth, resources, or health (both mental and physical).\n\n\nCapitalism: the means of production can be personal property. This means that a single person can control the flow of resources, wealth, etc. \n\nSocialism: The means of production is owned by the collective. This doesn't necessarily mean things are free, just that anybody has access to all resources, and nobody can gain or generate an inordinate amount of wealth off of a public resource. Everyone who owns a resource (literally everyone in the socialized society) has equal access and generates equal wealth from the resource.\n\nThe huge benefit of this system is that nobody profits off of an individual's labor more than that individual. \n\nYou can still own a personal gym if you really feel like it, but the local YMCA is co-owned by you.\n\n\n\nCommunism: The means of production is owned and controlled by the government. This is different from socialism in a lot of ways, but a primary difference is that the government is in control. In an ideal world, this is simply a way to make something *like* Socialism work, the problem is that the government can very easily be corrupt, like the USSR under Stalin, or incompetent, like the CCP under Mao. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's important to remember that private property still exists under all three systems, It's just that one system allows individuals to privately own and profit from a company, resource, or land that should otherwise be communal (think national parks)."

Similar to communism, facism espouces sacrificing the individual for the good of the nation. \n\n\nHowever, while Communism is (supposed to) work in favor of the collective group of people which forms the nation; Facism works instead for the interests of a subset of the populace that is some combination of  racist, violent, uneducated, nationalistic, etc. These people often think that imperialism is great, unprovoked violence isn't inherently bad, that anybody who disagrees with them should be punished, and that their country would generally benefit from cutting off international relations - after all we're the best, we don't need anyone else.\n\n\nUsually, they rise to power by appealing to the nationalistic view points of a specific sunset of society, and/or by exploiting the everyday struggles that people go through and blaming it on a 3rd party (foreigners, followers of a different religion, poor people, political opponents).\n\n\nFacism is sneaky, because it looks like a few people on the fringes of society, and then it very quickly comes into power. Either through military means (see Nazi Germany) or political ones (see Erdogan's turkey).\n\n\nOne of the hallmarks of modern facism is \"free and fair\" elections that are very much not either of things. \n\nBelarus, for example, had a relatively recent election where individuals took pictures of their ballots and sent them to a non-government server (so we know that at least x number of people voted for liberal candidate). However, the Belarusian government, on the official tally, said that the liberal candidate only earned a much smaller number of votes, despite verifiable proof otherwise. \n\nLukashenko, the dictator of Belarus, then changed the constitution to all himself to serve for decades to come without an election. If he does while in power, then a council votes on the new leader. A council that is headed by his son, and is full of his lackeys."

You basically don't know anything about this project and still trash talk it. Even after being educated in another comment chain, you refuse to adapt. That's called bias I guess\n\nE: Just saw that it unironically makes you upset, that he isn't wearing sandals in another comment. Jesus"

No one has watched everyone they love die then die themselves and return to their skeleton body. Not a lot of people could relate to everyone and everything they love being destroyed by a government body and chased as a criminal just for surviving it either like Robin. Even Namis backstory of being held hostage by a terrorist/pirate organization and committing crimes to free them is a rare situation most could not relate to. But Sanji's backstory is actually pretty relatable. Being looked at/treated differently/abused by his family because he wasn't the same as his siblings and running away from it all only to have to confront it later on (because he couldn't hide it forever) is actually a very relatable story to our real world. Just the basic story of abuse by a parent to that degree causing a lifetime of harm and trauma is a story many people unfortunately can relate to. Luffys is also very relatable and Usopps as well. I think Sanji is just a more fleshed character though."

It wasn't even seen by that many people you know, it was a huge flop, so I have a hard time seeing it have a big effect on the popularity of Dragonball merch, especially since Dragonball's popularity had been running on fumes for a long time by then, since the manga had ended a long time ago, and GT being a bit of a flop too. Until Battle of Gods, there wasn't that much to get Dragonball fans to keep encaging with the series.\n\nAlso don't you think that rather than a movie that couldn't even scrape 10 million dollars in American box office, the fall of the profits might have been caused by the financial crisis? I don't think many companies were filing huge gains in 2009, and somehow I doubt all of them had a bad live action adaptation based on their manga series."

I don't know where that claim is coming from, I just think that your retort makes no sense.  It's completely possible for Evolution to have hurt sales and for the new Toriyama movies to have brought it back.\n\nToriyama being upset about how garbage Evolution was is actually what made him do Battle of Gods."

Maybe it'll do some financial harm, but as with Dragonball being very popular to this day, so would One Piece survive and go on being pretty much as popular as always, as did Dragonball."

Dragonball Z was massively popular in the west and a large part of people's childhoods.  To this day.  One Piece on the other hand was massively impacted by having 4Kids do the adaptation to start with, and by the time Funimation got it TV and blocks like Toonami were way less popular than when shows like DBZ or Naruto became classics.  A bad adaptation can definitely sour getting newer people into the show, because One Piece *isn't* Dragonball.  One Piece was always a harder show to get into, that's what the adaptation is aiming to fix.\n\nPersonally I think it'll be a fine adaptation, but I don't think you can just say \"well DBZ lived\" when DBZ is a way bigger household name for the audience that this live action is trying to reach."

So what's the harm? A few more people who were never going to read One Piece anyway won't get into it because they didn't really feel the live action show? \n\nAnd yeah the 4kids adaptation hurt a lot, but that was because there was no alternative at the time. Times have changed, and whatever kind of product the live action show is, nobody will be stuck with it in the west, since we already have the show in manga and anime format widely available."

There's a lot of people out there who are only put off by the length of the series, and that's where a good adaptation can help or a bad adaptation can hurt in creating another boom for the series."

The best example of the difference in strength is when both used thunder bagua and since it is the same move and requires the same effort it is the best way to compare - Yamato used a defence shell but it was destroyed and was a failure shown later when Yamato said \"That thunder bagua, I thought I blocked it but I didn't even come close\" and there is a bunch of blood coming out however Kaido only had a few drops on his head and shows no marks later. Yamato blocked a few hits and equaled out blast breath, that is not trading equal blows at all, we also saw Yamato getting overwhelmed a few times by Kaido.\n\nYamato also has not shown to have or use future sight, in general the only characters shown to have future sight in Wano were Kaido and Luffy. Yamato also has not shown advanced armament, well at least internal destruction since with normal advanced armament it is hard to tell.\n\nThroughout their short fight Kaido was completely fine and most of the time had zero marks however Yamato consistently had blood, marks, and would say \"huff, huff\". Even after the fight Yamato was still huffing and was clearly injured despite being a mythical zoan. Although Yamato hadn't reached his limit even when Kaido was reaching his limit Yamato with Momo still thought they would die against him.\n\nKaido was also not going all out, he took Yamato seriously but we see later more and stronger moves with Luffy. \n\nThere is also the question with Yamato's fruit - he clearly had the same affect as every other controlled zoan awakening and if that is the case the fact Yamato still took so long to heal and was clearly quite injured after the fight speaks volumes.\n\nThe fact is other than a few attacks where Yamato blocked or equalised Yamato would be heavily overwhelmed and came out very injured while Kaido maybe had a mark from Yamato for a panel of two then went. Yamato did a good job, he managed to hold off for a short time and would still be able to carry on going, Yamato also contributed to Kaido start to become tired which is impressive but there is nothing to put him equal or stronger than Luffy (that's presuming you still think Yamato is that strong). \n\nYou could make an argument for Yamato being stronger than Zoro but that's it and it's not like either being a lot stronger than the other."

The difference is most of the fight with Yamato Kaido was clearly overwhelming Yamato and Yamato was losing most battles. Yamato also didn't do lasting damage to his body however Luffy at least later did do that.\n\n>Said possibly, since nothing says she doesn't have or does have, there is a possibility she does have because of Kaido knowing it and she learned every haki type by training with him.\n\nPresuming something is there when there was nothing to suggest otherwise isn't a good enough reason and training with Kaido is not a good enough reason. Garp used to train with Luffy but he didn't even have haki. The fact is Yamato did not show it or suggest that he had it.\n\n>since with just armament she showed can hurt Kaido in both manga and anime, Chapter 1025 and episode 1049.\n\nI am not bothering with the anime since that isn't a super trustworthy source, especially after the fact they gave Zoro conquers before he awakened it. Also in chapter 1025 there was no blood or mark so it is hard to say it did much. Also even if it did do damage that doesn't mean it is advanced armament, Kid did damage to Kaido just by hitting his head on the ground, despite no advanced armament.\n\n>But when Luffy uses all haki he have to defend himself from even Basic conquerors coating blows and gets hurt, you don't downplay him.\n\n>Fact Yamato ice alone could reduce damage so much, is a big feat for her.\n\nYou ignored the point of what I was saying there - all I was saying is in the thunder bagua hits Yamato even had an extra defence move just in case while Kaido just had himself however Yamato still came out of it severely injured while Kaido was fine which again speaks to the difference between them while when Luffy did stuff similar even before awakening he also just had himself but came out similar to Kaido.\n\n>Zero marks\" another lie. Kaido started the fight vs her all clean, when in 1 v 1 vs her he is full of bruises and at the end he is in exact same way how he was after he did defeat Luffy again in their 1 v 1, with just few bruises.\n\nExcept he wasn't, where are these marks that lasted more than a few panels and don't get it mixed up with clearly just detail.\n\n>The true problem here is peoples like you who keep downplaying her feats while being hypocrites at same time, the dishonesty levels you guys reach just to downplay her that is infuriating.\n\nExcept that doesn't make sense because unlike you most don't care about Yamato that much or have any reason to \"downplay\" her, I liked her but that's it. Look at my history and then look at yours - Who is more likely to be biassed about Yamato here? And why is it most know Yamato is clearly not at the level of Luffy but you do? There is also no hypocrisy? \n\n>Neither does Oldbeard, Big mom or luffy, and still they are at such level.\n\n>Kaido beats all of them in a 1 v 1 and by feats she is in that level.\n\nJust because they also lose doesn't mean Yamato is on the same level? What feats put her at that level?\n\nThe answer is Yamato didn't - Yamato fought a good fight and came out of it not at her limit however it was a one sided fight where Yamato was constantly overwhelmed and was reaching his limit fast in a short period of time while Luffy also didn't last super long but was dealing significant damage and taking hits from a stronger Kaido. If you look at portrayal Kaido constantly acknowledged Luffy and even shared a sky split with Kaido while although Kaido did compliment Yamato I guess by calling him a \"soldier\" multiple times for some reason Yamato's potrayel was set from the get go where he said multiple times he loses to Kaido. Even when looking at abilities you see a clear difference.\n\nI am sorry but again it is pointless debating with you. You're like Garry King (if you get that reference?) It was fun at first but I hate writing long comments especially when in the end it is pointless so I am ending it. Maybe we will debate again in your next \"Yamato is yonko level\" post.

In conclusion, he forcefully stopped his awakening.\n\nMaybe this is a future powerups for him, like from Vegapunk, him getting complete Exo and RS. This is the only way I can think of Sanji to barely reach Emperor level. This is needed because 1. his fellow Wings is gonna be at least mid Emperor level 2. he is PK's Wings, to respect PK title, Sanji needs to be that strong at least.\n\nWhat do you think"

BM didn't say law's attacks are more dangerous than kid's, she said that they are dangerous in general and that she needs to watch out for them (in other words she doesn't wanna get hit by law's attacks)\n\n  \nand what happens right after that? kid attacks, we see BM's scared face when she realizes she can't pull herself off of the assigned tower and then she uses all her physical strength (veins popping up on her face) to turn the entire tower around just to not get hit by kid.\n\n  \neverything said for law needed to be said cuz we can't see any of the damage he dealt. everything said for him also applies to kid. his moves are also dangerous to BM which is why she dodges, it's the exact same as law. if oda wanted to tell us that law deals more damage than kid, then he would have clearly shown that. and he didn't do that. BM didn't say that law hits harder than kid and she wanted to evade kid's attacks just as much as law's. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  \nnot to mention later when we see the image of the damage done to Wano it was Law's final attack which was purely his df (to our knowledge) that caused a huge hole almost the size of Luffy's final attack. \n\n  \nand literally overpowering BM counts for nothing? kid overpowered the one that can do ridiculous attacks like ikkoku with just physical might. and damned punk immediatly knocked her down on impact and kept pushing until it overpowered her\n\n  \nobviously law's attack looked more impressive, but that's also cuz of the nature of the attack and cuz it was his intention to punch a hole through the ground. but I greatly doubt that if kid was shooting his damned punk into the ground that it wouldn't also create a hole as deep as law's\n\n  \nand the one who was overall more impressive in the narrative sense is kid anyways. literally all his attacks got to be the cliffhangers of the chapters they were in and he also got the final attack to finish BM off, even with the classic beam struggle. and when we got the tower card symbolism, when the new tearing away the old was mentioned, we saw a close-up panel of kid and not law. say whatever you want, but oda's intention there was clear, he clearly focused more on kid\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  \nAlso just because Kaido didn't call it out doesn't mean Luffy didn't break Kaido's bones, he defeated Kaido for goodness sake.\n\n  \nluffy didn't break his bones until bajrang gun. his supreme/over kong gun hit kaido in the mouth while he was in dragon form and it didn't break a signle tooth. and if that attack didn't break kaido's bones, then roc guns or gatlings definitely didn't do that either. punk corna dio just is stronger than 99% of luffy's attacks. it's just that strong\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nand BM's final attack was stronger than kid's? do you mean misery? that for sure wasn't stronger than damned punk. and corna dio isn't that much of a \"big attack\" considering that kid used it twice in a row.\n\n  \nand BM healing those attacks was only significant during that battle, while kid and law were still inexperienced with their awakenings. looking at law vs BB, it seems like law already got used to his awakening since he used shockwille twice right off the bat and without huffing anymore. the same will go for kid. BM healing indefinitely doesn't matter when kid and law can break her bones indefinitely\n\n  \nand what do you mean by BM can exponentially increase her firepower? you mean her power-up by ingesting a year of her own lifespan? she just did that once. it's not a move she spams. even after being overpowered despite her powered up form which led to her ribs and arm being broken, she didn't power-up again, she just healed.\n\n  \nand her firepower isn't that great for kid considering that he tanked everything she threw at him. he tanked mama-raid even without having his guard up, he took misery and ikkoku and he also easily tanked fulgora despite being yeeted through the skull dome and several floors. both kid's and law's firepower are definitely greater than BM's firepower.\n\nkid's DF is without a doubt a top-tier DF. any DF that can deal significant damage to someone as tanky as BM is automatically top-tier."

It seemed like he did wanna deal with barto, but maybe if he heard something of BB ambushing pirates on the routes that lie behind wano, maybe he'll turn around.\n\nOther than a 3rd party coming directly to them, it's also a possibility that BB hears of Garp attacking his island. Maybe cuz Koby is too important for him to lose (we still don't know why exactly he even abducted him) or maybe just to protect his reputation as a yonko (can't let your main island you reside on get raided; garp invading and freeing koby Koby would be a similar disgrace BM had to endure cuz of luffy)\n\n\nI also thought about law exchanging the RP rubbings for safety. But it doesn't make much sense. On the one hand, law is confident that he'll win and get BB's rubbings. If the fight doesn't go too well, then law may think of that idea\n\nBut, you need to be in a power position to make this deal happen. BB would only accept it if he wasn't sure if he could win. So if law proposes such a deal cuz it's not looking good for him, then BB wouldn't accept it anyways.\n\nOnly way it could happen is if law is even with BB (so much so that BB isn't sure anymore if he can win), but his crew is about to lose and die. And that could only happen if law would be truly a yonko level combatant now. I'd love that. A lot. But I won't bet on it for now \n\nIdk about the ship. Idk if it's that important to BB. If it isn't, then he'll let it be destroyed and simply keep fighting till he wins and then wait for some of his fodder from hachinosu to come and get him.\n\nWhat is important tho is pudding. It seems like BB took her so that she can read RP rubbings for him, so he can't have her die. But maybe saving her will be easy since aokiji should still be on board, Idk why he hasn't appeared yet, maybe cuz he's supposed to guard pudding.\n\nBut if they successfully sink the ship and aokiji doesn't freeze it and the water around it (which would stop the ship from sinking), then they could force BB to leave them be and save pudding instead.\n\nThere's also the chance that the ship itself is important to BB since it's name is saber of xebec. And he clearly has some connection to him. Other than the ship's name there's also the fact that he took over hachinosu that was ruled by a former rocks pirate.\n\nBut what I meant with diving with the submarine was if law and his crew went back in there and tried to escape. That wouldn't work since BB forced them out of the water in the first place. With his quakes he made the water pressure rise top high for the submarine thus forcing them to go up.\n\nNow they can dive since BB is busy with law (if he tried to do something other than fighting law then the latter would immediatly punish him with a shockwille lol). But if they were to escape then BB could freely attack them with his quakes as long as they are within his range.\n\n\nEither way, I'd be hella happy if law could get out of this alive. I hope he does although it looks quite grim for him"

So it could have been Sanji.\n\nSanji has taken the lead different times in the story like in Water 7 where he was the first person to go after Robin and know what to do, in Dressrosa he not Zoro went to stop Doflamingo from hurting the crew.\n\nSanji's protecting his crew in WCI can also be likened to what happened in Thriller Bark since he was giving himself up for the crew to be safe.\n\nI'm not denying Zoro hasn't taking responsibility for the crew, all I'm saying is that it is not just him, Sanji had done it, Nami has done it.\n\nIn Wano they weren't following Luffy or Law's orders, Usopp, Robin, Franky and the Heart Pirates were following Kinemon's instructions, maybe you need to rewatch Act 1 of Wano again. Luffy never gave explicit orders to the crew about what to do in Wano when he was leaving for WCI in Zou.\n\nAnd back to the reason for this argument, the SHs don't have a vice captain or assistant captain. Even in the last released Bounty chapter they were all called officers with their respective roles, no one was called vice captain. The Strawhats Pirates aren't like other crews where an hierarchy exists between members, they're all equal except for Luffy who is captain over all of them.

The Navy and cypher pol are their tools to maintain the balance that they set. Once the balance is threatened (as is the Case now) they start moving. Just Look at whats Happening. They assassinated a King, nuked an entire Island and now send top Tier representatives to Deal With the sedition of their Chief Scientist. Enies Lobby, and even the war of the Greats, was childsplay against that."

Again. This is only my View in These Things. Not even in the least confirmed. Just me adding things together. \nAs to the need for Power structure when you can Just go and solo pretty much everyone is simple and straightforward. Its taxing and annoying. Way more comfortable to create an Organisation tasked with enforcing \"Justice\" and then just pop in when the underlings arent enough anymore. Its the Same principle as yonkou or basically any ruling entity. Governing is a Lot of work enough without you having to stamp out every little Rebellion yourself"

Hence my initial comment, which was just poking fun at the unlikelihood of the condition of \"not terrified\". IMO, domesticated animals are not comparable to wild animals in this scenario, their perception of human are vastly different, so it's a flawed inference. Now please do your thing.\n\n>Also dolphins are way too intelligent to be held in captivity without personal consideration.

Familiarize yourself with certain occult symbols.

So many Celebrities posting images on social media taking baths in blood, covering one eye (no way you haven't seen the image compilations of celebrities covering one eye right?)

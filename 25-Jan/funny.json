Could hear their clicks and sounds, but it wasn\u2019t the usual \u201c happy \u201c clicks. It was the stressful ones. The water was so murky , couldn\u2019t see 20-30 feet ahead. I finally gave in to my fear and headed to shore. Some ppl there said did you see the false killer whales following you? A pod had followed me for the short swim , maybe half mile each direction. ( I didn\u2019t see them) They are known to be one of the only dolphins to be aggressive to humans. Yikes right?"

It only took him maybe 15 min to really get it and then it was just such bliss \u2026watching him maneuver around the pool with just little brush strokes of his hands, hardly any movement at all. He was like a slow turtle \u2026 relaxed and having his first peaceful water experience"

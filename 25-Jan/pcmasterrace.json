The only area in which it's lacking is storage space and it doesn't come with an OS pre-installed.  [This would be a similar, but cheaper option.](https://www.skroutz.gr/s/38844829/Vengeance-Observatory-X-Gaming-Desktop-PC-i5-12400F-16GB-DDR4-480GB-SSD-GeForce-RTX-3060-No-OS.html)\n\nWhat you would do for the OS is use another PC (maybe your friend's?) and an 8GB or larger flash drive to create install media using the tool [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) (there's also one for Windows 11 if you prefer that).  You plug that into your new PC when you get it, set the thumb drive as your boot drive, and follow all the instruction steps (just skip any steps where it asks for an activation key - you can either run it completely unactivated or buy an activation key later).\n\nIf you find yourself needing more storage, you can add additional storage to the PC via an M.2 drive (if whatever PC you get has a free port) or SATA drive (a 1TB SSD should be 75-80\u20ac or lower based on my googing for your area).\n\nApologies if any of this is off the mark.  Tried to cater to your area as much as I could based on some googling, but there could be other stores or options I missed as I'm not familiar with shopping in Greece. \ud83d\ude05"

Steam being an exception. Sure, there are still physical copies for consoles, but most people buy digital nowadays. Then there are the DLCs, season passes, etc. that you mentioned.\n\nIt's really fucking funny, when they started crying about not getting enough money and then increasing the base prices of AAA games, while as you also said, the quality of the products they make getting worse and worse as time goes on. \n\nPrices increases, while quality decreases and the overall cost to distribute games became almost inconsequential.

      "body": "Well, OP, the bad news is it's going to have to be an everything-but-the-case upgrade, but the good news is that you're officially in the \"anything is an upgrade\" category, and with 1000 CAD at your disposal, you're looking at some serious room to play around.\n\nYou say you're somewhat inexperienced to this, so I'll break down my recommendations and some general industry trends here for you, as I think that might help you.\n\n1) unless your power supply is ancient or really low wattage, it's probably best to hold on to your power supply and case. Both of these should be perfectly compatible with a new system, provided they were off-the-shelf components originally. You can save yourself some money this way, and you can put that towards some Steam games, or a good mouse/keyboard or a microphone.\n\n2) We're currently in a transitional period between DDR4 RAM and DDR5 RAM. DDR5 is more expensive, obviously, but has started to settle down into more reasonable pricing. Because you're doing a whole system upgrade from a setup that old, and with a good, thick budget, I would recommend getting DDR5 RAM in your system, because this would give you greater longevity. If the price of a full kit is too much, just buy one stick and run with that for a month or so, then get another. You'll take a performance hit, but even a hobbled modern system will run rings around your current CPU, so don't sweat it.\n\n3) With RAM sorted out, that narrows our options down to AMD 7000 series processors, and Intel 12th and 13th gen processors. Performance in the low, mid and high performance tiers between AMD and Intel is very competitive, however, Intel is retiring their LGA1700 platform this year, whilst AMD has only just started with AM5, so I would recommend going with an AMD processor. The Ryzen 5 7600 (non-X) is an exceptionally capable CPU and comes with a stock cooler that should be good enough, provided you don't want to overclock the processor. Otherwise, tower coolers that can handle the heat better can be had for very little money, so grab something like a Scythe Fuma if you're worried about thermals.\n\n4) You'll want an SSD. NVME drives are best, but a SATA drive is acceptable. Avoid HDDs like the plague. You can get a 1Tb solid state drive for dirt cheap these days, so just pick up an NVME drive with as much capacity as you can afford and don't worry about the speed too much, as literally anything is better than a hdd, and you can easily upgrade down the line if you want.\n\n5) Unfortunately, DDR5 compatible motherboards are expensive, so just go for the cheapest one you can find, as they should all give you fine performance, so long as you make sure the BIOS is up to date.\n\n6) After the full system upgrade, you should have around 300 to 400 dollars CAD left, so I would recommend an AMD RX6600 or 6600XT, if you can afford it. If you can snag an RX 6700XT for within your budget, either new or second hand, then this would be awesome. If your budget comes out tighter than that, then a used RTX 2070 or 2060 may be within budget, and in the worst case scenario, a GTX1660 or 1660Ti/Super should be well within your grasp, and you can always sell it to finance an upgrade later.\n\n7) Intel recently entered the graphics market with their A750 and A770 cards. They offer attractive performance for the price, but unfortunately, they have some serious stability and behaviour issues, which are particularly bad on older games. If you play predominantly modern games, then an Intel GPU may be worth a look in, but otherwise, I recommend you steer clear of Intel GPUs until at least the next generation."

[https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/NpMdW4](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/NpMdW4) this is what I'm currently going for I doubt I'll need to upgrade anytime in the future but please tell me if there's anything that's the same for less or a bit better for a little bit more."

      "body": "Hey, that looks like a really good setup. That's a powerful machine right there, and I'd only really recommend a few little nips and tucks to get more for your money.\n\nThe biggest one I would recommend is to change the Ryzen 5 7600x for the vanilla 7600. You'll save a bit of money and the performance difference between them is nearly nothing. If you're just gaming, that GPU is going to hit its limits WAY before that CPU does on most games, so you're unlikely to ever notice the difference. \n\nSecond, is to cut out the cooler. The 7600 also comes with a stock cooler, which isn't amazing, but the much lower 65 watt TDP of the 7600 means that the stock cooler will keep it under control, and in most scenarios, you're unlikely to have that stock fan spin up so hard you'll notice. Try running it with the stock cooler for a while and if you find that the computer behaves poorly, you can get an aftermarket cooler for reasonably cheap.\n\nWith that money saved, you might want to get some 6000 mhz RAM. I said RAM speed doesn't really matter, and for the most part that's true, but Ryzen 7000 really likes that specific speed, so it might be worth a look. Otherwise, your RAM is fine.\n\nNext, if you can find an NVME drive that uses PCIE 4.0 instead of 3.0 for about the same price, or slightly more, I would recommend getting that. You won't see much improvement in real world scenarios, but if you start up a game that uses DirectStorage, you might see some benefit to the extra speed, and generally, if you can get one for only ten dollars more or something, it's better to have it and not need it. Alternatively, the SSD there is perfectly fine, and a solid choice.\n\nFinally, if you go for the 7600 and lose the cooler, you might be able to put the money into a better GPU. If you can find an RX6800, that would perform that bit better, or alternatively, something like a 3070 would offer better ray tracing performance for a similar price, if you much care for ray tracing. Alternatively, you could go for a bigger SSD, or maybe a few RGB goodies.\n\nEither way, that's a really powerful PC you've got there and the parts list checks out good. Just a few nips and tucks would give better overall value, but the system you've got there is absolutely rock solid."

I expect to fully upgrade my current DDR5 by the end of the year possibly beginning of next year as I know timings and kits will likely be much much better.\n\nCurrent DDR5 mt/s don't really wow me purely because timings are in most cases double or triple that of DDR4. I mean this was the exact same scenario when we had DDR3 and DDR4 came out. Overtime better kits come along, timings drop and then kits will move into the sweet spot and become a standard.\n\nI plan to look into it more but from what I was doing I saw a +/- 5-7 FPS change going from 4000 CL14 to 6000 CL36"

No, it has zero effect on speed.\n\nYou can clone your existing OS onto the new NVME (given there is enough space). Then you can format the old SSD, keep it attached, and use it for faster game storage. \n\nThen later, if you get a new PC, you can pop out the M.2 NVME from the adapter, and slot it directly into the new motherboard. Or you could keep it in the adapter.  The PC doesn't see the M.2 differently (adapter, vs port in the motherboard); both are just PCIE.\n\n\\------------------\n\n>....cpu how do you tell if the it is going to be bottlenecked the gpu \n\nThere are calculators that can tell you.

It does come with a somewhat wide range of printable materials (PLA, PETG, Nylon, ABS/ASA, flexible TPE/TPU, Polycarbonate). A FDM printer fumes are still not either pleasant, nor particularly healthy (depending on the type of material you print with, it can get toxic, but baseline is not healthy for extended durations either).\n\nSo if you're only going to be printing miniatures, and have the space to exhume the fumes, a Resin printer will make sense.\n\nIf not, and you're still able to ventilate your room, a FDM printer will be what you'll need."

Should run the CPU a bit colder than otherwise\n\nNegatives:\n\n* Only 8GB of RAM ([however a upgrade kit is only $50](https://www.newegg.com/corsair-16gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820233859), although it requires you to install them yourself)\n* Only 512GB of storage, same issue as the previous machine.\n* Only 1 year of limited warranty\n* The Intel ARC graphics cards are so new, that they still have some \"child issues/sicknesses\" as it's called.

Which is why I thought the monitor was the issue until I decided to try it again and I see the color is okay at first"

Then the onboard motherboard RGB.   Next thing you know I'm buying RGB LED Fans.  slippery slope I guess lol"

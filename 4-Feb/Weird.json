A version of it was even in the game of thrones.\n\nIf u think about it, it is actually very logical. In a society where birth amd bloodline is really important, a matter of continuation of ur linage, wouldn't u want to make sure? Like what if a year later, the bride who is another noble's kid runaway and claim that the marriage is null and never consumated? \n\nMarriage by law is a relatively new concept.

And by \"most\", let's say 500 out of the 700 hundred years, still left 200 where witnessing is required, the whole of american history. \n\nWhat i'm saying is that for potentially hundred of years, it is witnessed. It is hard to pin down where \"most\" started or ended. But it is a tradition and significant cultural change. In today's world, this is completely not acceptable. But back then it very much is for a long long time. We just don't know for how long, how common, how much is required viewing."

      "body": "This is the second reply, in case reddit mess this up.\n\nr/AskHistorians has a very very good discussion on when privacy during sex become important in the western europe too. A bit of a rabbit hole but you can read more about this topic. Like I said, the transformation happened 1500 to 1600, in the middle of the source for the wiki article I linked.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/24uikm/when\\_did\\_people\\_start\\_having\\_sex\\_in\\_private\\_or\\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/24uikm/when_did_people_start_having_sex_in_private_or_is/)\n\nAnd again, it is very logical. Churches did allow marriage to be disavowed if it is unconsummated for a period. So at some point, the church probably want to make sure that marriage they approved did get consummated.\n\nSecondly, most homes for poorer households did not have the capacity for privacy for a long time historically. While two have sex, every other member of the family are basically unwitting witnesses. So it would make sense that even when private rooms become common, some places will treat witnessing sex as tradition. This form of low privacy housing very much existed into the 18th and 19th century in the form of Icelandic Turf House [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic\\_turf\\_house](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_turf_house). Hard to have sex without everyone else seeing it here. But again, hard to definitively prove if people actually had sex in them while families are inevitably around (Icelandics might be hardcore celibate, who knows). Going further back into history, the viking long houses can have dozens living in them. Their sex life will definitely not be private and cultures have to adapt.\n\nUnfortunately, neither of us will have definitive proof as traditions tend to be a patchwork. So you do see people in the same thread raising proof that the romans may have the concept of sexual privacy earlier (100-500AD). Then again, they usually describe sex as a \"secret thing\" rather than \"private thing\" if I'm not wrong. The poster also said that sex being private and it being public are not exactly conflicting as well.\n\nPlease keep this discussion civil. While I get we are discussing sex, but I'm not here to get swore at. Just some serious talk on a weird topic."

He would glance in a window or mirror and see himself in the form of an entirely different person, and ad lib his  reactions to and actions toward others who believed and acted toward him as if he were the original person, the consciousness of whom I suppose slumbered in his subconscious while he sits in the consciousness \"driver's seat\".\n\nOne of my favorite episodes was *The Colour of Truth* in which Sam, a white man, leaps into the body of an elderly black man in the ravages of the Jim Crow South.\n\nThe Pantheopsychic process of salvation, as spoiled above, is simply a matter of Christ, like Sam Beckett in the tv series, lapsing into an eon's long non-lucid dream while dreaming of dying upon the cross (a dream within a dream, as there is only George Berkeley's Idealism in existence) to assume the identities of every human that has ever existed (if Universalism is true) or only the identities of every human that shall be saved (if Annihilationism is true as Pantheopsychism denies the existence of eternally punishing Hell in lieu of obliterating the wicked from existence following biological death), believing He *was* each person and suffering every sin the person shall commit and every negative experience the person shall encounter, before \"leaping\" to dream of being the next person or next saved person, etc. etc.\n\n\"The foolishness of what was preached\", indeed, but nevertheless a logically and metaphysically possible form of the actual nature of reality.\n\nJay M. Brewer\n\nPantheopsychic Philosopher\n\nAustin, Texas"

These beings are not merely animals. Also, do you really think that a person's first reaction to witnessing something that is often traumatic to them and fear inducing, are going to react by saying oh geez let me take out my phone and get this on camera.

Have you seen the movie?They where supposed to be evolved to be more human. I guess a better comparison might be the apes from 2001. Now those were beautiful costumes. \n\nNow if you are talking about film your talking to the right guy. I was in the film industry in the art department for 10 years in the early 90s. I can tell you a little about production. It's easy to make a costume that looks good for a single shot. The talented comes from a costume that can endure 12 to 14 hours of shooting over 4 to 6 months. That's hard.\n\nNow as to the condition of a particular costume after 30-40 years, you need to  understand what they are made of. These are traditionally made of slush mold latex with wig hair punched in. That kind of latex starts deteriating after a few years. It gets sticky and gummy and any wig hair that is around it starts falling out or clumping together. I was given one of the masks from a low budget film called Scarecrows that worked on. It was a cool mask but after a few years I had to throw it away because it was just a mess.\n\nAnyway sorry to drone on. Realy my other points are better. Not enough food, no bones and less video even though there are video cameras in everyone's hands. There are even night cameras. We don't need  video, bones would be enough."

So about as natural as \"gelatin\" is. \n\nHere's a bit of bast I've been trying to spin, its tricky because most of my work requires high twist but bast is fragile and breaks VERY easily... my spinning wheel cant go slow enough! The rayon (its dyed) is super easy to spin and behaves more like silk, very fine and very strong.\n\nThe rayon averages about 12micron width \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/3LTv8wh"

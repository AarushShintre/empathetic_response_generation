It's more noticeable when moving around. Should work on 1.12 since it's just a texture replacement. Or if I misunderstood and you want *less* visually obtrusive weather, there's a good pack called [Soft Weather](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/soft-weather) you could use.\n\nMy shader of choice is [Complementary Reimagined](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-reimagined) which mostly adds fog and color change instead of making the particles themselves more noticeable. Not sure if a newer shader like this would work on 1.12, but you could give it a try.\n\nI tried combining Better Rain & Snow and the shader, and there was a very slight difference. Particles seemed more noticeable if I looked hard enough, but I think the shader's effects and fog overpower most of it. That's about the best you're gonna get; there are mods that overhaul rain/snow into individual particles but none of them are for 1.12."

Love the thought process too, plus the editing on the video\n\nThe only thing I would criticize is the story, which sounds a little too forced(?) to me. Theming is super important imo for making the player feel immersed and like they're doing something diegetically meaningful.\n\nFor example, instead of using bedrock, you can make certain regular blocks indestructable and build the room out of those, to decorate it. One theme I'd considered for this kind of idea is that you're one of Santa's elves, constructing different types of presents. The room in this case could be a room of Santa's workshop. You could even have a fake door that can't be opened (so the room is still enclosed), but gives the player the feel that it's a real space. \n\nIn my original conception, it was something like Santa had crashed at your house, and the playable area was your living room, except you're resized with Pehkui so the blocks are tiny and the room is built at a larger scale, which justifies the scale of the things you're making with blocks. Plus you could use a Create train as a model train running on the carpet around the Christmas tree, which was a really cool visual in my head.\n\nOr maybe you're a futuristic assembly-line construction robot that's gained sentience and has to eventually try to escape, while solving rooms, Portal-style.

So I think it could be interesting enough.\n\nI also have some floating ideas of how I could\nmake it much deeper, however I don't think I can push the medium of minecraft modpack too for a story.

Not entirely sure how it'll work but I'll look forward to seeing more videos on it!\n\nMaybe instead of it being a bug, it could be a human, with the big people outside being monsters of some sort who deliberately farm and trap humans in these automation cubes to do their labor for them? Sort of like a *Promised Neverland* kind of vibe. That might make it more intuitively immersive since it'd be easier to put yourself in the shoes of a person?\n\nAnd not to sound like a broken record but you could even make parts of the cell out of glass and use Pehkui to make a giant creature looking at you from outside, that's a pretty cool visual\n\nHonestly I think a lot of the design ideas I have tend to revolve around wowing the player with some cool set piece or visual.

The other major modloader is Fabric. Almost every modpack is either a Forge or Fabric pack. Modloaders pretty much determine what mods can be added to a modpack and are essential to running modded minecraft.\n\nThe FTB App is a Minecraft launcher. It is used to download, manage and play various modpacks.\n\nMost of the FTB modpacks are Forge (there is a recent one that is Fabric). Direwolf's 1.19 pack is a Forge pack. So using the FTB app does not exclude you from accessing the threading chunk rendering option.\n\nTo get to this option, go to the main menu or Esc menu in your modpack. Look for an option like **Configs** or **Mod Options**. Once in, either search for **\"Forge\"** or scroll to it and select it. Go into the configs. Then look for \u201cForce threaded chunk rendering\u201d, and make sure it is turned on. That's what that bullet point is talking about. It has nothing to do with the launcher.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nTo add and subtract mods, go to a modpack, look for three dots somewhere (should be next to Play), then open the Mods Folder from there. From there just drop the .jar of a mod you want to add, or delete the .jar of a mod you don't want. Then that's pretty much it. Becareful when updating modpacks though, they may 'forget' your manual changes. Just check the Mods folder everytime you play your modpack."

I do not need to be muslim myself to acknowledge that name in various permutations is central to muslim beliefs, and as such I should expect strongly worded reactions if I use that name anywhere lightly. \n\nOr, to stay with religious concepts, use the term zen somewhere without taking into account what it usually describes. Or various gods and godesses from Hinduism. \n\nPaganism is a bit different since it's not acknowledged to be widespread nowadays, and as such I'd be hesitant to expect everyone to know major concepts of those.

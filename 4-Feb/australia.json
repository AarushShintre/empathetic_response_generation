For the vast majority of people, it does more harm than good.   \n\n\nI've said this term several times in my comments but all opiates when used for a long period of time cause hyperalgesia ie. an increase in the sensation of pain. If I were not to discuss this with patients, I'd be most likely actively hurting them.

This is why Australia is teaching this collaboration method of patient interaction and moved away from a paternal medicine style (ie. \"I am the expert and I have last say on what is best for you, and no I will not explain.\") It's a slow change, but if you are in the medical field you should be able to see the difference in the different generations of health practitioners and one for the better. Pain medicine is also just a very difficult field - not all pain is associated with damage to the body. If it were I'm sure there would be more options to treat it. But with our current knowledge its often a battle of give and take.   \n\n\nAt this stage, I seem to be a punching bag for some frustrations with the medical system which while valid, is not appropriate to direct my way. Unless you have specific examples that I can learn from (I am autistic, so I do value that opportunity to learn), I think this conversation is done."

But what a lot of dr don't realise, and this is what I mean about the way you come across in replies; telling people that you acknowledge their experience but that \"the vast majority\" don't agree with them, is, well, paternalistic (among other thing). It seems you obviously don't mean to be, as you're nicer than I should deserve as I have been hostile, but it is. And this is a trap that any highly educated group inevitably falls in unfortunately.\n\nWhen I read a study or a write up I always look at who didn't follow the norm, and how often that happened. I see so many doctors, not just to myself, but that my patients tell me about, that really don't want to see the experience of people that aren't typical or \"expected\", even including people having side effects to medications. Which can be dangerous. \n\nAustralia has demonised codeine to the point that I have seen signs in multiple practices saying \"we don't prescribe codeine\". This is what people around Australia deal with, and it is in part due to this constant speaking about codeine like this and not looking at it with nuisance. I should apologise, as you are coming at this with more thoughtfullness than most, but your voice adds to the overall noise that causes those who don't want to think about it, to put signs up like this across the country, and that then hurts people unnecessarily.\n\nAs you have agreed with, codeine can still be used effectively, and I think the national conversation needs to shift towards \"effective prescribing\" rather than \"alternative prescribing\", because the latter causes codeine to be excluded and looked down on, rather than seen as a legitimate part of the toolkit. And i guess that is what I've been trying to get across, this negative talk around codeine rather than neutral talk; I feel it is inadvertently harming patients."

      "author": "This-Understanding10",
      "body": "I had a bit of a think about your comment because I will admit on the first pass, I didn't understand. Now I think I can understand that having your own experience essentially deemed 'weird' and 'not normal' would feel isolating, dismissive and rude. You are a person, not a statistic and no perfect science is going to capture the vast spectrum of human experience. \n\nWhen I talk to patients that, as you say, didn't follow the norm, it's going to spark my curiosity and that of many of my colleagues. We have seen a vast spectrum of unusual and finding out why is important. Sometimes it's an old prescription that has mistakenly never been stopped. Sometimes a patient has been on it for so long, it's a remnant of an old practice. Sometimes it's a preference of either doctor or the patient from an experience they had. Other times a patient didn't even know what it was! By asking, I am checking that there is no error, no better option, or just the patient's thoughts. I type all this out because, in truth, the shorthand for this in conversation is often the phrase \"oh that's not the vast majority...\" with a question at the end, either explicit or implied (or something similar). And that yeah, sounds judgemental.   \n\n\nHowever, having experienced the many patients that are on codeine because of any number of the above examples with the knowledge that yes it does do harm to so many people, I do feel it's important to always ask about it. Otherwise, I would potentially do harm. \n\nIn the context of this thread, where there are a lot of people mistakenly stating that it is an excellent drug that was pulled and that there is nothing to cover the gap it leaves I do think it's important to state how ineffective and harmful it can be and that there are alternatives available to explore - and I speak in the general sense because I speak to a general population on a Reddit thread. The knowledge of options gives way to nuance, that can be discussed on the scale of an individual.  And whatever works on an individual level is valid.  \n\n\nAnd to state clearly, codeine is not recognized as a good drug due to comparisons of how our other drugs perform -  it has extremely variable absorption, pro-kinetics and effect. For some, it doesn't work at all. For others is equivalent to a small dose of morphine. Combine that with the risk of increasing pain, increasing adverse events and risk of addiction and it makes a poor profile to something like a statin which shows improvement in life expectancy in the value of years or meloxicam which lasts a whole day with consistent pain reduction and little risk. However, it's not bad because it's in the opioid family. It's not bad due to stigma. It is still a valid option.   \n\n\nThat is very a broad summary describing clinical medicine vs public health. I hope that I've captured my intentions in this not being a personal attack, but rather an explanation of why I and other health professionals say the things we say - always with the intention to help rather than harm.   \n\n\nI do agree that Australia does demonize codeine - in fact medicines, in general, are still viewed in a very negative light - they are chemicals, big pharma trying to hook you into their pocket, they are not natural etc. I've seen and had experiences of people criticising those who choose to take medicine as being weak, or a failure of some kind. And I do recognise coming into a thread that is filled with nay say for something that works for you, after coming from the fight from the outside world would start to get a bit much.   \n\n\nI'm not quite clear on the terms effective vs alternative prescribing. I believe that the national conversation should include our current knowledge of pain and how big of a role our environments and brain can impact it - the ultimate aim would be to cure chronic pain entirely, and as our understanding of pain continues to grow we move closer to that goal. That being said codeine is a legitimate part of the tool kit, and I don't think I have presented a neutral view of it, I think it can be argued that it is nuanced.   \n\n\nThis is now very long, I apologise. Thank you for engaging with me in a positive way. I hope the rest of your night is restful and that your future interactions with our healthcare system are more positive."

Think of it this way, say you have a $50k debt in todays money which you never pay off. Well in 30 years due to inflation that $50k only buys you the same amount of goods that $25k would buy today.

I spend 2,000 hours a year around it and that's considered a safe dose. I don't know if unshielded is 5x, 20x or 100x worse.\r  \n\n\nOn the plus side, the missing capsule should be detectable at a reasonable distance, so it's conceivable that they'll find it."

The gauge we have (Nuclear Density Meter, or \u2018nukes\u2019 as we call them) is used to determine the in-situ density and moisture content of compacted soil in the field. It\u2019s a probe that we put down a small hole in the ground, and the gauge reads the amount of radiation that passes through the soil over a known amount of time (normally 60 seconds) at a know depth (normally 100 \u2013 300mm). \n\nWe wear small devices on our person that absorb radiation and these are tested regularly to ensure we\u2019re not receiving too high a dose. There is legislation in place to ensure correct use, storage and transport of these devices.\n\n\r  \nThere are dozens of labs around WA and some of them would have dozens of nukes."

It's a very small amount are men who know what specific actions are sexual harassment and/or assault, but do it anyway.\n\nA lot of men will message or approach a woman multiple times despite rejection or lack of acknowledgement, and they just don't see that as wrong, scary, or a big deal. They've grown up in a culture where it's repeatedly reinforced that \"women play hard to get\".\n\nWe still have men who don't realise their average size is greater than most women, and it makes them come across as intimidating in a lot of situations by default. Most men would find another, much larger, man standing over them to be just as intimidating - The frequency of that occurring is much lower, though.\n\nYou're making the assumption that everyone actually knows what sexual harassment/assault is/isn't and that it's people who choose to commit it anyway. We know this isn't reality. For example, if you've ever 'persuaded' someone which involved you repeatedly asking and ignoring their rejections, you have probably committed sexual assault."

      "body": "I don't know any men in my family or anybody elses family that were taught not to rape. They were told rape is bad, but always in the context of a woman was raped and murdered, or raped horribly by a stranger. By all means, you're welcome to provide all the evidence showing any education men and boys are able to take that provides clear, concise, and effective education on what constitutes consent. Mum and Dad telling you 'rape is bad' isn't at all effective or educational.\n\nI know women are taught not to be raped. We're frequently told how to avoid it, suggested solutions for protection, and encouraged to take self-defense classes - People even tell us what to drink and what to wear. I have never, not once, seen a single media report about the steps men can take to not sexually assault/harass women.\n\nI have multiple nephews, a brother, and a father. They don't seem to recall ever being given any equivalent education or suggestions. They all know sexual harassment/assault is bad. However, my father and some of his co-workers thought it was appropriate to buy a female coworker a sex toy. He didn't see that as bad, and his co-workers didn't see it as bad, as to them it wasn't sexual harassment. When I told my Dad he sexually harassed his co-worker, he became very flustered but eventually understood that's what he had done regardless of what he thought he had done.\n\n\"Men are taught not to do that\" - Apparently quite shittily because sexual harassment and assaults continue to this day. With a main defence against accusations of sexual harassment and assault being \"I didn't know it wasn't consensual\" \ud83e\udd28 because most sexual harassment and assaults aren't violent and horrific. \n\nThey're basic things like:\n- People not recognising body language that signifies rejection.\n- Messaging someone a picture of your genitals when it wasn't asked for.\n- Asking someone out or asking for their contact details while they're at work. Finding their contact information through official channels and using it.\n- Leering at them, making suggestive jokes, or obscene gestures.\n- When someone says a clear no to a sexual act, and you continue to repeatedly ask them.\n- Repeatedly asking someone for a date, despite an initial rejection.\n- Intentionally brushing up against someone 'accidentally'.\n- Finding out where someone is going to be so you can 'run into them' or waiting for them in places you know they frequent just so you can accost them.\n- Driving slowly to watch a woman jog, or beeping your horn at them.\n- Making lewd comments on photographs of women.\n\nIf the thousands of Australian men who made sexually harassing comments on the photo of Tayla Harris are simply men that knew what they were doing was wrong, but did it anyway (As you seem to suggest), well... that's a bit horrific that you think men would be so knowingly shitty. \ud83d\ude15"

      "body": "Wow. Mate, if you think men commenting on a photo with such disgusting comments that lead to a woman  contacting Police is somehow equivalent to the comments you'll generally see on a photo of an attractive male... you've got screw loose. There are literally thousands of examples where women have had to contact Police over men threatening to rape them for simply existing in a photo. \ud83e\udd28 I don't think I've ever heard of a photo where mass amounts of women threatened to rape a man.\n\nYou have every opportunity to provide sources for how men are taught not to rape. What articles are targeted towards teaching men not to rape? What resources are provided? How did your parents teach you not to rape? You have this grand claim it happens, yet you just say \"I was taught!\".\n\nWell, I wasn't taught not to rape because I didn't have thousands of years of baggage that first taught me that I had some innate right to men or that they were less than me. \ud83e\udd28 There's not millions of people around the world telling me that men are my property. There's no 'girls will be girls'. We are also raised on stereotypes that emphasize empathy - Activities which boys are only now not being shamed out of participating in.\n\nWe also still don't make up 99% of sexual assault/harassment perpetrators - You're actually far more likely to be raped by another man than a woman.\n\nI understand that reality is upsetting, but if you haven't done those things, there is really no reason for you to be upset. Look at me, not getting upset at you saying women rape too! Why would I? I'm not a rapist and I can confidently say I've never sexually harassed anyone."

      "body": "They do, which is why I suggested you mention some. Still nothing yet.\n\nYes, they can, yet there isn't a massive problem where women are threatening to rape men. You are free to share an example of this. Regardless of whether they're taken seriously, find a post where women are mass threatening to rape a man.\n\nYou are obviously quite upset because you're becoming quite animated and clearly distressed. You've just told me you feel sorry for me because I said there is a proven societal issue with understanding consent that men are well-known to struggle with - making up 99% of rapists. Bit of an aggressive mood to imply/suggest that the men in my life are like the men I painted in my comment. Also strange, considering I never said they were - seems more like a defensive knee-jerk reaction.\n\nYour view seems to think that rapists are all horribly awful people who take women by force in a dark alley. That is simply not the case, and even the ones that do don't generally see themselves as rapists. There was a study from the University of North Dakota where college students were interviewed using different sentences to describe rape. 31% said they have or will have sex with a woman using force. That number reduced to 14% when they were asked if they would rape a woman.\n\nConsidering you believe that photos where men commented \"About an inch away from seeing the full ham sandwich\" as equivalent to the language seen on mens photos. We'll use Dustin Martin as an equivalent comparison since he's considered an attractive AFL player - sportswomen don't need to be nearly as attractive to attract the same comments. Most of the comments by women on one of his photos were asking him to marry them or be the father to their children. I couldn't find a single comment where a woman made a vulgar comment towards his genitals.\n\nThat's a very obvious disparity, and for you to be unable to recognise that and your multiple attempts to dismiss the greater severity is concerning."

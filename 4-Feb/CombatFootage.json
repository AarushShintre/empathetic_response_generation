There are other subreddits where there are more balance between people of each side and shows the conflict is not so pathetic by the russian side, this is one r/UkraineRussiaReport.\n\nAlso I think you are disgusted by the russian army performance, which I think the propaganda have made you over exaggerated those things. What I think, seeing the data, is that russia is not whiling to use most of their military in ukraine at the risk of having again many losses like they did in the first months, because they know they will need that army for possible future wars more dangerous for them."

There was a similar article for IFL volunteers as well shortly after that call was made. Twitter tried to have this discussion, but it was quickly shut down for the exact line of thinking you have. Nothing can ever be negative about Ukraine right now because they're some sort of arbiter of freedom or something and they somehow get a hall pass on racism and white supremacy.\n\nAgain, I'm not shilling for Russia, just stating a fact. Ukraine has a pretty large white supremacist problem that they need to address after this war, that doesn't mean they don't have the right to defend themselves from a brazen and illegal invasion, nor does it mean those same types of people don't exist in Russia. It means what it means.\n\nHopefully you can see where I'm coming from. White supremacists (see: Nazis) exist everywhere, but Ukraine doesn't get a bi round on it just because they're being illegally invaded by Russia, and we don't get to ignore it because Russia is using it as a tool for justification.

You're also ignoring the fact that the Israelis won't even open a criminal investigation of their own into the events. \n\n> Journalists deliberately separating themselves from militants is not proof their killing was deliberate.\n\nThe sum total of the situation leads to the conclusion that the killing was deliberate. The problem is that there is a lack of further clarity, which would be provided by an investigation, which you justify not holding. You're having your cake and eating it. \n\n> By all accounts Israel has conducted an investigation\n\nYes, the IDF has held an internal investigation and found it did nothing wrong. It has resisted every form of independent investigation. Incredibly, for the person complaining about bias, this constitutes an adequate response! Funny how that works."

I've said this repeatedly. You're also completely ignoring the lack of an Israeli criminal investigation. \n\n> A lack of evidence is not evidence of something, and drawing conclusion with little evidence is generally a bad idea.\n\nAnd you're both hiding behind a lack of evidence and justifying a situation that perpetuates that same lack of evidence! The natural corollary of a lack of evidence is to find more evidence!\n\n> Israel has held/is holding an investigation, the outcome of which they have not released.\n\nWhat investigation do you think is ongoing? The IDF concluded their investigation last September. \n\nThey have cleared themselves of wrongdoing by arguing that the death was accidental. By definition, accidents do not place blame. They've also claimed that it is still possible the bullet was fired by Palestinians, and anyway in a situation arising from Palestinians placing soldiers in lethal danger (actually the only concrete finding by the IDF report). Saying you likely shot someone, but by mistake, and anyway it was the Palestinians' fault is exactly the whitewash feared all along.\n\n> They are not denying an investigation in itself, they are simply denying cooperation with the US on an investigation.\n\nThey refuse to hold an Israeli criminal investigation."

But back in April, I met with Andriy Biletsky, the founder of the Azov movement, at their base in Kyiv. I had not heard of the Misanthropic Division then, but I did ask Biletsky about foreign fighters. \u201cWe have volunteers from different countries,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve had Europeans, Japanese, people from the Middle East.\u201d He also mentioned Belarusian, Georgian, Russian, Croat, and British volunteers. He pointed out that some of them had been Jews. However, \u201cI can assure you that there are no Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even western Europeans for that matter,\u201d he added, slightly contradicting himself.\n\nThe Azov base, in the semi-industrial outskirts of Kyiv, was in an abandoned Soviet factory compound. Inside the main building, a yellow flag with Azov\u2019s notorious Wolfsangel symbol in the center hung from the rafters. In two places, there were Black Sun clocks on the walls; such sun wheels, or Sonnenrads, also found on the floor of Heinrich Himmler\u2019s castle in Germany, are widely used by contemporary adherents of Nazi ideology to signal their Aryan supremacist beliefs. Azov apologists say that they are merely indigenous Ukrainian symbols that must be understood in an Eastern European context. In any case, the sun wheels, backlit by blue neon, certainly lent the Azov base a neo-Nazi aesthetic. There were soldiers in full battle gear walking around, looking as squared-away and intimidating as any in Ukraine, and two women who worked as secretaries. The ground floor was full of new recruits, exclusively young white men, speaking Ukrainian and Russian.\u201d\n\nhttps://theintercept.com/2022/06/30/ukraine-azov-neo-nazi-foreign-fighter/\n\n\n\nGuess it\u2019s nazis fightn nazis then"

Technically you can be correct, but it would be borderline insane.\n\nThe report says some active german army units that stationed in germany lack equipment (Gro\u00dfger\u00e4t =tanks). Units that are in duty in foreign countries usually have most of the equipment (80%), but even they lack some stuff.\n\nWhy could you theoretically correct: It could be - in lala land basically - be possible that the tanks germany send are from a specific unit who has reserves, while other units in active service lack them. But even the report actually contradict this (insane) assumption, with the statement that the german army scrap stuff together from different units to get the units that are on foreign mission somewhat ready.\n\nAnd no, the german army doesn\u00b4t send 100% of their available units in foreign engagements.\n\nI think I know what you mean by \"in storage\". I was in the german army (admittedly is a while ago). The german army has this units. And no, we are not talking about this units, but actually active service units. So units which are the response force, if NATO (or Germany) is attacked for example. \n\nI can\u00b4t blame you for not understanding the report (due to not knowing the language), but it is 100% clear.

And to argue that the Nazis- a group that literally turned Ukrainian faces into handbags- could author a symbol fit to represent the Ukrainian people without any ideological baggage attached is absurd. Ukraine already has a symbol for nationalism. It\u2019s called the Ukrainian flag.\n\nFinally, if you think authoritarianism and antisemitism are the only things wrong with the Nazis, I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\n\nYou are a wartime propagandist glorifying Nazis and asking if there is any indication that those sporting Nazi symbols, who the Western media not long ago condemned ubiquitously as Nazis (and spoke similarly of all of Ukraine).\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention: how is Azov dipping bullets meant for Chechens in pig fat for anti-semitism?\n\nAnyway, I know you\u2019re very emotionally attached to cheering on Ukraine like a sporting event and any criticism must be deflected, even if it requires arguing that the people tatted with black suns and swastikas, sporting Totenkopf and wolfsangel tattoos aren\u2019t Nazis somehow.

The fact you brought it up indicates to me that we\u2019ve been having the conversation I suspected we were having. One in which I was making objective statements about Ukraine and you were deflecting them because you\u2019re in the state of mind that you must either be pro-Ukraine or pro-Russia.\n\n\u201cA symbol only has as much power as someone\u2019s ideology\u201d a symbol has no power except that of broadcasting what someone\u2019s ideology is. I\u2019m sure they claim they\u2019re not Nazis when they want your support. But if we look at their actions and chosen symbols, it\u2019s pretty clear cut.\n\nI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not reading any sources about how the innocent Ukrainians who just so happened to \u201cadopt\u201d all the same symbols the third reich used aren\u2019t actually Nazis because they say they aren\u2019t and actually the Swastika is an Indian symbol and the Totenkopf originated in the Weimar Republic, and so and so is a Nordic rune. They all have one thing in common: fucking Nazism. Idk why you think otherwise but Nazism doesn\u2019t stop existing in Ukraine\u2019s borders. They know what it is. It\u2019s more relevant to them than it is to us.\n\nFinally, authoritarianism is inextricably linked to racism and homophobia. The government may have elections, but there are more dimensions to the matter.\n\nIn this last paragraph you again imply I support the invasion. I never said anything of the sort. You\u2019re giving me plenty of insight Into your mindset though. You just have pro-Ukraine brainworms that make you refuse to accept any realities inconvenient to your narrative. But reality is nuanced.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t say they deserve to die. But I will. If someone with a black sun, Totenkopf, wolfsangel, or any other Nazi symbol bites the dust- I\u2019m shedding no tears.\n\nTo be clear on how full of shit you\u2019ve been, your view in summary is:\n\nThe far right people who promote Nazi collaborators electing to use *multiple* Nazi symbols is a coincidence.  They just chose them all because there are no symbols of the Ukrainian people besides those used by the people who genocided Ukrainians.\n\nThe far right, racist, homophobic anti semites sporting Nazi insignia aren\u2019t Nazis because they haven\u2019t recently commented on the Jews and don\u2019t have \u201cauthoritarian leadership\u201d in a military unit, whatever that means.\n\nWe should take the word of a group we\u2019re currently supplying military aid to in spite of the fact that our common consensus before the conflict was that they were Nazis.\n\n\nAll of that aside, if your best argument is \u201ctechnically they\u2019re not Nazis because they aren\u2019t in power in government and don\u2019t want to genocide Jews, just other minorities\u201d then I rest my case."

In which part of it that happened?\n\nAnd stop treating this war as comparable to the second world war, it's only really comparable to that from the Ukrainian perspective. The URSS was fighting a defensive war from which it had no way out, against an enemy that wanted to genocide them. Russia is now fighting an offensive war from which they can easily quit by simply removing Putin. Ukraine's position, if anything, is significantly more comparable to the URSS. The URSS and Russia had difficulties in offensive wars since time immemorial, [from the Crimean war in 1854](https://www.reddit.com/r/dancarlin/comments/u8yg01/the_economist_on_russian_military_weakness_during/) to the Polish-Soviet war, from the Winter War to Afghanistan. \n\n>  and like we faired any better in Afghanistan with images of Afghani civilians holding onto the landing gear of C-130s as they left Kabul.\n\nWhat the fuck are you even talking about? The US lost fewer people in 20 years in Afghanistan than Russia lost in the first few months of this war.

      "body": "Lol here you go again with the accusing people of trying to sound smart. And you ain't got shit little boy, you just exposed how next level stupid you are. Honestly it's almost impressive, if it weren't so sad. First off, you started the personal attacks by telling me i should be ashamed of myself because i don't format my reddit comments, so once you initiatedthe insults i returned them, what's the matter, you can dish it out but it hurts your feelings when someone stands their ground and insults back?.\n\n Second, i am literally just talking, i am putting absolutely no effort into seeming smart, the fact you think my basic speech is an attempt to sound smart is an indication of your intelligence level, not mine, because if i was actually invested in sounding professional and intelligent in this thread i would have chosen much different vocabulary and actually spent the time formatting and putting effort in. \n\nThirdly, not once did i suggest i am superior or even think that i am, because i'm not. I am a completely normal person with nothing extraordinary about me. All i did is simply call you out for your hypocritical, irrational arguments and you didn't like it so you started trying to make me feel like i'm insecure and you're getting pissy now because instead of making me feel bad about myself you've provided genuine comedic relief from the boring argument i'm having with you.\n\nFourth, the reason you keep accusing people of trying to appear smarter than you is because you are very clearly insecure about your own intelligence and based on everything i've seen that insecurity is well placed because the level of intelligence that have gone into the comments you accuse of being attempts to appear smarter have been extremely low grade. Like if grade 9 students worded it the way we have on a school paper then i'd be worried they aren't trying, because everything we've said is literally bottom of the barrel basic vocabulary and basic logic and reasoning, nothing even remotely approaching elevated intelligence, but because you are such an absolute dunce you think other peoples baseline descriptions and vocabulary are indicators of higher intelligence. You keep thinking everyone is intentionally trying to sound smarter, which makes you the common denominator. so what's more likely, that everyone around you is intentionally pretending to be smarter, or you are just a magnificently airheaded individual? occam's razor would like a word to give you the answer to that. \n\nAnd my final point to prove what i just said is the fact you just said my arguments about ukraine are completely off, when i haven't said a single word about ukraine the entire time we've been doing this little back and forth, you're literally confusing me for a different person talking about a different topic you absolute, ignorant dumbass. I have not uttered a single word about ukraine in our argument and have offered no opinion on the subject at all and the closest i came to giving an opinion was in my first comment when i actually said i agreed with you, so if my opinions on the conflict are wrong that means you yourself are wrong since i was agreeing with you. You really didn't think that one through did you? Which i'm sensing is a bit of a pattern with you. Anyhow, i have solely been calling you out. So just do yourself a favor, listen to the actual adult and sit your insecure, stupid little ass down before you out yourself as an even bigger doorknob than you already have. \n\nRoasting you was fun, this was a fun way to waste some time on a lazy Saturday morning cuddled up in bed with my dog, but now i've got grown up shit to do (don't worry, you'll get there some day too if you actually start focusing on your studies and not acting tough on combat footage reddit threads.) So i'll be going now. Feel free to rattle off some more insults or faux mental evaluations about me and my mentality and attempts to appear smarter than i am, but i won't have time to reply today which who knows, maybe that will make you feel like you bested me, i hope that you get to feel that feeling for a short time, cause everyone else knows you made a complete and utter fool of yourself, but i'll see if i can find time tonight to check in and see what other repetitive insults you've thrown my way. And maybe, just maybe if you give me a good one i might even reply. Alright, see you later kid, this was lots of fun. At least for me, i hope you had fun too."

For the first several years the game was simply free to download and they had a PayPal donation button if you wanted to support the game.

What you described as your initial model (giving everything away for free and just having a patron with nothing locked behind it) was their final model before having to sell the game to cover medical expenses. Up until the steam release the never released anything behind any type of paywall. It was a fully free ride system. No one had to pay anything to enjoy all the fruits of their labor."

      "body": "Firstly patreon is a regular auto pay system so so it provides some regularity to it letting you know how much your getting roughly month to month (barring any major sudden shifts). \n\nIt\u2019s also a smaller amount but more consistently and long term that tends to pay out more, most people won\u2019t re-donate much more than the initial $5-15, but most people can easily forget about $1 a month for years upon years mixed in with other monthly subscriptions.\n\nNext, they also were originally doing this under a very different culture online than there is now. Maybe this doesn\u2019t mean anything to you but I think it matters that back then donating to a random project online wasn\u2019t the same kind of thing as it is now. It was far less ubiquitous, and much more risky and sketchy. It wasn\u2019t considered a viable income source until these last few years. It\u2019s the same kinda difference between having a popular YouTube channel in 2006 vs today, it wasn\u2019t really a profitable system and you didn\u2019t expect to make a survivable amount of money. Meaning they spent a huge period of their development working under the impression this was never going to be profitable. They initially did it purely because they wanted too. \n\nLastly while they easily could have turned up the profit by locking some of the games aspects or something behind a paywall they never did. Lots of creators do give out their content for free at the beginning because that\u2019s really the only way they can bring to gain some following. It\u2019s extremely rare that a creator will reach their level of popularity and still keep it that way. Indicative of a lack of profit motive even when they could have. They constantly kept the funding for the game to a minimal only taking in enough to survive until a sudden medical expense came about. \n\nTo summarize: \n\n1.\tunpredictable unprofitable income for many years\n2.\twhen they started it was clear there was no expectation this would ever make money, and thus that they made the game simply because they wanted to make a fun game \n3.\teven as the game became more popular and supporting games via donation became more mainstream they still didn\u2019t make any major shifts to how they take in money. Adding a patron but making it $1 a month. Indicating that even as it became clear they could make a lot of money from the game they chose to continue to develop it with the free model. \n4.\tthey only made a major shift to the income model when they literally could have died without it.  At witch point they decided only to charge to make a version of the game they didn\u2019t want to but everyone was requesting. While still keeping the core game free. \n\nThe point being dwarf fortress is clearly a passion project and has been developed that way before it was a thing. But unlike other games that start as passion projects they didn\u2019t turn it into a major profit center and sell out when it became popular enough. They only sold out to not die of medical issues. \n\nTL;DR it\u2019s not unlike any other $1 patron project out there except that none of those projects stay that way for almost 17 years. Usually either they suck and disappear or become popular enough to go up in price. Dwarf fortress didn\u2019t until the creators health was in the line"

Not being aware of that context the final leg of their journey seemed much less remarkable. It\u2019s like thoes online video channels from the days of early YouTube and even before YouTube where they made this stuff for basically free as passion side projects while they worked day jobs and just took donations on the side to offset the cost of equipment and supplies. Except as the online scene grew pretty much everyone else sold out for a piece of the giant pie that is the money to be made on the internet, they just didn\u2019t and now almost 20 years later they\u2019ve been forced to sell out. So with it comes 17 years of good will for having held out until they couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s a nice example of people being rewarded for not being selfish. Much closer to the idea of a \u201cself made\u201d millionaire than any other real life examples"

I also expect you to price it at $15, making it probably the most expensive of its kind (not including collections of 150-200+ variants). rs1 was also overpriced at the time (still is, compared to other titles), surely this will be too, but I'm also sure it will sell well enough, people will pay for anything, especially if it's pretty, so that's good for you. and with 150+ solitaires in my library, about half still unplayed (and I almost always have a different one in progress), I can wait a few years until it hits what I think it's worth, just like I did with rs1 (for which I still paid more than I normally do for 150-200 levels of sameness, and I would've made an exception with rs2 as well, had it improved in the department it needed improvement in, but it'll be good enough still)."

The game has all new backgrounds, characters, story, story items, special cards, metagame (shop screen), levels, intro movie, etc. All the UI has been painstakingly uprezzed, polished and reformatted for widescreen.

I realise BFG has a subscription system that means you can get it for $6.99 but the base price is still $9.99. If other games price themselves cheaper on Steam, that's up to them but they are are a standard price on the casual portals as you know. There was a time in the past when casual games were $19.99 if you recall, but Facebook then mobile free games have eroded that price.  \n\n\nWe still have to make a living so that we can make more games, and we prefer differentiate on quality of experience (all aspects) and theme/story, instead of merely the number of levels. I don't want to play 300 levels of a badly made game. I'd rather play fewer levels but enjoy it more. AAA games often have the same problem tbh.  \n\n\nAlso inflation (in the UK) since 2015 is quite a lot, plus the game will be a CE game. So yes it will be a bit more than $9.99 but with a launch discount and also a bundle discount for collectors of our other games.

(not saying every game has to be for everybody, I even sort of agree with not putting easy mode into dark souls, though I don't agree that it'd hurt the game and it'd absolutely not hurt any *normal* person's ego or experience of them playing on hard, but unnecessary gatekeeping is not great either.)\n\nwildcards are the same. in-game money is plentiful, so why not let players spend it on consumables if they want to, whether levels are properly balanced (as much as possible because rng is rng) or pretty much impossible unless you luck into a good card order on your 124th try. I noticed a dev response under jm atlantis solitaire 2 that said certain people complained that *optional* power-up purchases were too cheap in previous games, so they could *optionally* make the game too easy, so prices got raised in atlantis 2. see above, narrowing options to appeal to a smaller amount of players with no impulse control instead of expanding options to appeal to a bigger one.\n\nbalancing games must be hell, especially with multiple game modes and such, and wildcard prices are a part of it, just like cosmetics, upgrades or whatever else you have, but it's much easier for anybody to make a game harder for themselves than easier if there are no options. you can simply not equip that big-ass sword you found that kills everything in one shot, but if that sword is not in the game, players with less dexterity/skills are fucked. of course, proper balacing and settings can handle most situations because why were you working so hard if you can't even enjoy the big-ass sword as a reward? (and the lazy way to do it would be level-scaling, which ruins any feeling of progression, yet a lot of people love it.)\n\njm solitaire already has a hard mode, so maybe put increased prices there and leave easy mode as it was, that would be an improvement or good solution, not screwing with pretty much everybody. in your case, you could limit in-game money so it's barely enough for all upgrades by the end, not leaving enough for dozens of wildcards, but that would improve nothing, only increase frustration, as it would require tons of replays, not to find random wildcards but to farm enough money for them and/or the rest of the upgrades.\n\nI appreciate your assumption of me being a very good solitaire player, but unfortunately it's not true. I got so much money because I had to replay a bunch of levels due to rng (part of the game, no problem even if it can get really frustrating), and on some harder levels I had to use wildcards (can't spend in-game money on irl patience), which in turn meant replaying earlier levels for more wildcards for the rest of the harder levels, leading to even more money I couldn't spend on anything. vicious circle. what you wrote about the new power-ups sounds interesting enough and obviously you know more about them than I do, so they might be enough to fix (or lessen) the main ssue I had with rs1.\n\nthis got a bit long, sorry about that. the point is, you can't please everybody, as you said, but I'm a big fan of options, be it game modes, settings, quality of life, accessibility or whatever, and the more options you offer (within reason), the more people will be pleased.\n\nas for golf or something else, I wouldn't be buying and playing solitaire by the dozens if I had a problem with it, but I always appreciate it when things are mixed up a bit (or a lot, though I can't stand deckbuilders, so maybe not too much). and funnily and sadly enough, that's why I still haven't played shadow hand yet or the more recent revills games (so not sure how good or bad they are, though you might not have tried them either and might be surprised), because it's a bit more complex/complicated even if it's just +1/-1 at its core again, plus it's also supposed to be longer than flicking through 200 levels in 5-10 hours, so I'd have to treat it as a 'real' game, not just my weekly dose of good old solitaire."

Some games do that with valuable resources like lives. I guess for you that would be annoying too.\n\nQ. What about limiting the amount you can buy before starting a chapter? e.g. to 3 or something (could be more in easy mode and fewer in hard mode, though of course you actually need more in hard mode. I'm guessing you did more farming for hard mode.)\n\nNote that if you can buy wildcards it will make the shop item upgrade which starts every hand with two wildcards obsolete, at least for the first few hands in a chapter. Also it makes upgrades which boost wildcard chance less meaningful, and the new wildcard-based powerup less cool. These are knock on effects of changing the design.\n\nWe could have a warning when purchasing wildcards that says it's not how the game is meant to be played, but that might make people feel bad about buying them rather than putting off the people who might make the game too easy for themselves. Certainly I don't think we want to draw attention to such a button with a tutorial or similar. Another option would be to have it disabled in the Options Screen and the ability to switch it on (or the other way around).\n\nQ. There are a few places we could put such a button. Which do you think is best?\n\n\\- In the shop screen (though it would mess with the layout we've already designed). This means you can only stock up between chapters, but that's when you are in the shop anyway.\n\n\\- In the game screen on the actual fan of wildcards so that you can buy them whenever you want. Perhaps it could be a subtle \"+\" button so it doesn't obscure too many wildcards. This might seem useful but it would really break the game balance and make it too easy imho as you could make giant combos and get out of any situation. This is probably what F2P games do as the WANT you to buy extra ones. They probably pop up a thing saying \"buy more wildcards!\" when you run low in fact.\n\n\\- On the in-game menu as an extra button.\n\nQ. Do you also want to buy jokers? If so, they should be a lot more expensive. Also more game breaking. Related: I don't think we'd allow players to choose what number they get on bought wildcards, the game would just randomise that.

I guess for you that would be annoying too.\n\ndon't think I've seen a solitaire like that. multi-level power-ups for sure, or bigger batches of cards for cheaper, which is also very mobile, I guess. there can also be a limit, as you said, and sometimes it's very low, on how many wildcards/jokers a player can have at a time (they're usually counted together even if they're purchasable separately). or only allow one of each, which can actually be handy because what am I gonna do with 5 aces and no more slots for others.\n\nand yes, I'd find it annoying and somewhat unfair. let's disregard that I find most things and their opposites annoying by now, it's a me-issue, but I always feel like punishing easy mode players is counter-productive. I get that normal/hard has to have some advantages besides more satisfaction from harder enemies, but I'm playing on easy because I don't want or can't handle much of a challenge, yet the game gives me less xp/money for killing enemies, so by the time I reach the boss I'll have 2 things unlocked/bought and still struggle, while on hard they'll have enough for 4 or 5, which they might not even need because they're better players. it'd certainly make people think twice about buying and using wildcards, but that can also make it less fun. can't use them for 150 levels, some of which will be a struggle, because I might not have enough cash for the last 50 levels, which are bound to be a lot harder. I imagine there'd be a cap for prices but still.\n\nbtw, I didn't play rs1 on hard because I'm also annoyed if I have to replay a whole chapter just because I fucked up level 8. this is more common, actually, many solitaires have it as an option. these days I don't care about 3-starring puzzlers even if they're not tied to a timer, which I always ignore/turn off, but in solitaire (unless it's really unbalanced or not fun) I still aim for removing everything because leaving cards on the board is just not right. might have to come back later with more power-ups or just try again another day, but can't do that in rs1 hard mode.\n\n> Note that if you can buy wildcards it will make the shop item upgrade which starts every hand with two wildcards obsolete\n\nless powerful maybe but surely not obsolete, same for the chance booster. they just mean you don't have to spend as much money on wildcards, and also that you can afford more if need be. now I'm very stingy with in-game currency and consumables, who knows what I'll need, have or have access to later, so I might retry level 36 a few more times and grab that wildcard instead of using or buying one and moving on to level 37. this of course is what I did in rs1 already, but being forced to and doing it willingly aren't the same. so I'd probably still unlock any and all wildcard-providing options before upgrading the 'remove a card' power-up to remove more cards, for instance.\n\n> We could have a warning when purchasing wildcards that says it's not how the game is meant to be played, but that might make people feel bad\n\nit's all about the phrasing. I'll never forget your crying bunny on the exit screen in spring bonus, very manipulative for such a kid-oriented game. a toggle for it also works, though I doubt too many people even look at the options in games, which is a shame. the most elegant solution, I think, would be to put this on the start new game screen. easy/normal/hard, differences explained (timer, no replay, etc.), and a tick under it all for purchasable wildcards yes/no. and you can explain that the game was designed and meant to be played without this (so it'd be unticked by default) but feel free to use it, won't affect money/rating/achievements/whatever people might care about. so whether they spent 5k on a power-up or bought 10 wildcards, a cleared level would still be 3 stars. you can maybe add an achievement for a no-wildcard win, discouraging people to use it if they care about such things (I don't, so you'll be happy to hear you can do with achievements what you will without causing me the slightest annoyance - unless you spam 5 for every completed level, that'd be bad).\n\nagain, solitaire/casual players are probably a bit different, though they might have the same ratio of care/don't care about achievements or perfection in other ways, would be an interesting study. but for example jewel match has achievements for 3-starring everything, yet provides an easy mode that has 2 decks, but if you start the second, 3 stars is not possible. if you want 3 stars, whether for the achievements, in-game display or self-something, no point in playing on easy, but if you just want to play levels with 2 decks, it's an option. same gameplay, same money, power-ups, wildcards, but no extra achievement.\n\n> Q. There are a few places we could put such a button. Which do you think is best?\n\nI'm a huge fan of user interfaces, menus and stuff, but this is tricky to answer without knowing what the game looks like exactly. putting it in the pause menu doesn't sound great (I've seen games putting undo there, very bad), the shop makes sense and the playing area too. I've seen this layout in another card game (and their m3s as well):\n\nshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2769105170\n\nseparate buy cards screen: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2769105627\n\nboth are available while playing a level: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2769105600\n\nas annoying as it is to me yet again, I understand you might not want people to buy them freely while playing a level, but not sure how it'd cooperate with the replayable single levels thing. on easy you can do that instead of replaying a whole chapter, but one might use all their pre-purchased wildcards because they replayed the first 5 levels 20 times until they got them right, and left with nothing for the remainder of the chapter. however, it definitely makes wildcards less abusable and should be enough of a restriction on its own to excuse/allow their existence, but a toggle/note/achievement/whatever else is still fine. and if you go with the shop expansion, it can be done in a similar fashion as above, separate screen and just an extra button in the shop to get there.\n\n> Do you also want to buy jokers? If so, they should be a lot more expensive.\n\nyes, might as well, and sure. and as said above, if there's a limit, they could be counted together, so if you have 5/5 wildcard slots filled, you can't buy a joker either.\n\n> I don't think we'd allow players to choose what number they get on bought wildcards\n\nagree again. they're wild for a reason (another reason but still)."

And yes I'd display this fact on the choose mode screen along with other mode parameters.\n\nI am still undecided on adding them to the shop or fan area but appreciate you taking the screenshots. I just realised adding the option to the shop means we also need to show the players current wildcards, which is more work.\n\nRegarding having a purchase limit, the wildcard fan can hold about 10 max but I'm just wondering if it's worth preventing the player from buying wildcards if they already have 5 (or fewer in hard mode if we allow any at all). Perhaps that's just overcomplicating things though. Actually I just realised it's pointless having a limit mid-level because you could buy one, use it, buy another, use it etc thus getting around the limit. The limit would only make sense in the shop between chapters.\n\nI might not allow purchasing of jokers as that could be too powerful. Though if players are prepared to buy and waste wildcards (mid-level) until they get the value they need, it's has the same effect as buying a joker.\n\nAnother option could be to allow wildcard purchases only at the start of a level but that would require special messaging to the player.\n\nAnyway lots to think about."

      "body": "> So if we added wildcards only to Easy mode (not hard mode) you'd be OK with that?\n\nI still don't see an issue with more optional options on any difficulty, but fine with me. easy is easy for a reason, hard should be harder. and it can still be fun if done right, but as I said, I'm not a fan of full chapter replays in solitaire.\n\n> I just realised adding the option to the shop means we also need to show the players current wildcards, which is more work.\n\nif you add mid-level purchasing, it can be a pop-up window, not covering the bottom of the screen where the owned wildcards are shown. still wouldn't help the shop interface and might as well make it consistent. though the wildcard window can still be the same pop-up in the shop if owned wildcards while are also shown at the bottom there, possible scaled down, only showing the top or something, so less of a shop screen rework is required.\n\nabout a possible limit, 10 is pretty generous, and sounds like any further complications or limitations would just mean more work for not much gain. don't see why players shouldn't be allowed to max out all the slots between chapters if they can afford it, and while playing they might have 6 wildcards but none currently usable, so why doesn't the game allow to buy more when at the beginning of the chapter there were 10 there? at least that'd be my train of thought.\n\nhowever, in hard mode you could allow only 5 (or anything less than 10) wildcard slots, bought or found. sounds like the limit is the same regardless of difficulty. I'm not sure if 10 found-only or 5 (or 7 or 8) found-or-bought is better for what you want to do with that difficulty, that is if you're still considering purchasable ones there.\n\nas for jokers, if they're in the game already, might as well have them as a separate, more expensive option for a sure-fire solution.\n\n> Another option could be to allow wildcard purchases only at the start of a level but that would require special messaging to the player.\n\nwouldn't that be messy with replayable individual levels? also for the player. cards ran out, gotta restart, buy more, try again. if they're gonna use 5 wildcards to pass the level, might as well use them on whatever's left of the current layout.\n\nI'll play the game at some point whatever you end up doing, but I'm glad we had this discussion, some insight into solitaire dev is always interesting."

      "body": "Ok thanks for those thoughts. If you have time for one more question:- Currently in hard mode if you fail the harder chapter goals you have to replay the chapter. I could remove that and do something else to make the game hard e.g. limit wildcards to 5. Can you think of anything else to make it harder? (I don't want to change the level layouts or reduce the stock size). Maybe I could reduce the gold you earn a bit but there's a danger players won't be able to get vital shop items, though I guess they can farm gold by replaying older chapters if need be.\n\nPossible we could add a nightmare difficulty and that is the mode which makes you replay the chapter. Then there's the question of if you should get an achievement for that or not. Normally in our games the achievements aren't too hard so people can 100% them, unlike some other games. But having this one could annoy some people. Then again, this mode won't actually be harder than hard mode in the original."
    },
    {
      "author": "Dohi64",
      "body": "hmm, harder goals sound interesting, and with nightmare mode added and only that requiring full chapter replays, I might go for it myself. I only recall one solitaire with challenges (haven't played a jewel match that had them yet), though 'chapter goals' might just mean 'have x 3-star levels', like in faerie solitaire, not 'make a combo of 3 spades' on a specific level (forgotten tales: day of the dead had these, mostly fine/fun but the 'no misclicks' one was incredibly frustrating).\n\nit'd be great if game mode could be changed anytime (might've been already possible in rs1). nothing worse than realizing halfway through the game that you have to start over. level select should mark how each level was completed, so after solving level 25 on easy just to progress, players could go back later to do it on hard, and of course hard would count as an easy solution as well.\n\nto increase difficulty you could reduce money or increase power-up prices. gotta think harder about what to buy or farm money on previous levels, as you said. I have a mindset very far from players who play everything on hard or competitively, but some of them enjoy grinding/farming for sure, and it was there in rs1 as well, if not for money, then wildcards.\n\nyou could also nerf some power-ups (mention these somewhere, of course). not sure what they are exactly or how they work, but e.g. if the one responsible for wildcard spawns has a 15% chance on easy, hard would be 10%. or if there's one that turns 3/5/8 cards over at the beginning, it could be 1/3/5. same for random card removal, though I assume that starts with 1, so lvl1 card removal would be the same across the board or increased to 2 cards on easy.\n\nor you could increase charge times (just looked at the screenshots, they're fill-up icons, would be nice to have actual numbers until recharge on mouseover). if it's 20 played cards, make it 30, if it's on a real-time timer (hopefully not), increase that. wildcards could also cost more, and/or the aforementioned lower number of them. or you could penalize undo, though that might be more fitting for nightmare (clear board with undo wouldn't be 3 stars, or each undo would take some money away, or reset the multiplier in progress). or each power-up could only be used once per level even if they're recharged (they should probably 'turn off', inactive icon, instead of charging again and causing confusion).\n\nas for achievements, there's no pleasing those people, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. they'll whine about everything and their opposite (much like myself, except I don't care about achievements at least, just looked and I'm missing the 5x multiplier and 35x combo in rs1, probably because I was saving wildcards for later and by the end was happy to finally finish and move on). adding more content, free or paid, with or without achievements, easy or hard, grindy or cheesable (like normal completion in rs1 if you played on hard, though the game shouldn't work like that in the first place, see above), doesn't matter, somebody will complain.\n\nif you have info or stats about your players, you can decide if a nightmare achievement is something worth adding (I find that 'casual' players can be hardcore too, but in a different way). or decide after release, again based on stats/feedback. if the icon is drawn, fits the ui (if there's an in-game achievements screen) and data is already there in the save/profile, should be a quick patch that triggers retroactively as well."

In our games you can choose difficulty mode on the map screen between chapters and beating the game on hard gives you the easy completion achievement as well (but if you beat hard levels with 3 stars it doesn't give you 3 stars on the easy levels, something to consider perhaps.)\n\nAnyway I'd better get on with finishing making the game now!"

If anything, I would think a better product to sell would be a Raiden 3 HD Version that features an updated graphic style as one of the play modes on top of having the new BGM and the original content included. Add in the ship roster from the Raiden Fighters series and it would be a stronger game. It's interesting that the BGM is such a prominent angle here. It is assuredly not something that will draw non-fans towards the product, but it's nice to see the BGM composers have this level of recognition."

I was of the impression that vaccinated people experience less breakthrough infection and disease, and therefore are less likely to infect others? I know vaccinated people can still spread the virus, but they're less likely to be infected in the first place, and if they are, to be symptomatic, so I thought they were less likely to infect others.\n\nLike I said, though, it's been a year since we had any covid restrictions in my country, so I might be remembering wrong. A private event asking my vaccination status is as unlikely here as it apparently is in Florida. But during the pandemic, it was common.\n\nAnyway, this is veering into anti-vaxxing territory real fast. I'm not very invested in this, I just thought it was weird.

So again, a bad reason to equate the situations.\n\nIf you still feel discordance from the seeming disconnect between two *wildly* different situations, then perhaps in actuality people of your country just aren't taking COVID as seriously as they should rather than GDQ and the rest of us taking it too seriously."

So the vaccination status of someone who has had one vaccine and then the actual disease is exactly the same as someone who's had the vaccine and one booster. I just assumed the same was true in the US.\n\n>there are plenty of people who can't obtain it due to other medical issues.\n\nWhy would those people who have been medically unable to get vaccinated want to be at an event together with a lot of people whose vaccination status is unknown?\n\n>Common and a \"good\" thing are not always mutual.\n\nSure, but why would it be a \"bad\" thing? That's what I don't understand here. You seem to be arguing from a very principled argument, which is commendable I guess, but a couple of comments back I asked why it would be a problem in practice. I still don't understand what the practical issue is here. Do people just not want to disclose their vaccination status out of principle? Do people not want to GET the vaccine out of principle?

You can't deny someone purely because of disabilities or other ailments they may have.\n\nOf course. And that seems reasonable to me. The base case should be that a private company can choose their own patrons, except that in some cases, they shouldn't be able to discriminate. Again, this is a practical matter based on historical precedence.\n\nThe main question here seems to be whether laws should be general and principled, or detailed and practical. You seem to think the former - and if you're American, I guess that tracks with how your constitution works and all that - while I think it should be the latter. Laws should solve actual problems, IMO.\n\nIf people are needlessly discriminated because of things like sexuality or disability, then make that discrimination illegal. And if people endanger public health because they don't want to get vaccinated, then make it legal to discriminate based on that. Problem solving.\n\n>However, I would say that it's potentially opening the door. Once it happens and you allow it to continue, companies may want to implement that in various other circumstances.\r  \n\r\n\nTo stop that, why not reverse it? Pass a federal law saying that you generally can't ask people to disclose their medical information, and you can't discriminate based on medical information, except for vaccination status. That should stop companies from implementing it in various other circumstances.\n\n>To prod into that a little bit, why not? Why should a private corporation be able to decide that? Should the government be able to limit that?\n\nWell, why not indeed? It's a matter of public health. There are already lots of alcohol-related restrictions here - you can't sell beer to someone under 18 and liquor to someone under 20, stores can only sell beer and only before 8 PM, the government has a monopoly on selling liquor in closed containers, etc.\n\n>Under what circumstances can the government or businesses limit the ability of a woman to do something based on her being pregnant? \n\nDo you want me to hammer out the laws right here and now? I mean, I'm not suggesting that the government should pass a law right now that forbids bars from selling alcohol to pregnant women. This is a thought experiment. But I'd let the lawmakers and researchers figure that out.\n\n>For example, how do you feel about them meddling in abortion?\n\nThey already do, don't they? Women are generally only allowed to take an abortion before week 18 in my country, but otherwise the government (public hospitals) perform them, and women have a right to them. This is all written out in law.\n\n(Of course, for consistency with the alcohol argument above, we could say it should be legal to sell alcohol to a woman who's been pregnant for 18 weeks or less, or some other limit, probably based on science.)\n\nI guess what you're asking, to make this analogy work with the previous discussion, is whether the government should be able to let private doctors choose whether to perform abortions, or whether private doctors should be able to refuse to perform abortions?\n\nThe latter would be somewhat consistent with the ongoing discussion, and I believe that's how it already works here in my country - a private doctor doesn't have to perform abortions if he/she doesn't want to. (Of course, a public doctor who refuses to perform abortions would be fired by their employer, ie. the government.) That seems reasonable to me.\n\nBut this \"slippery slope\" argument seems, again, to be a very principled stance by you. I don't understand why we can't be practical and let private companies ask about vaccination status without allowing the floodgates to open and allow them to ask about all kinds of other stuff, like pregnancy. Just pass a law specifically saying that vaccination status isn't considered a private matter, or something, and it should cover it.\n\n>If you follow the line of vaccination passport to entry, those places could have a claim that you are required to have a doctor sign a proof of fitness before allowing you to participate.\n\nThey could just require the vaccination passport to entry. You're the one who seems to want to expand this into other kinds of medical statuses.\n\n>Likewise, anyone requiring public transportation can be denied if they might potentially have a medical episode because it would be bad for the service.\r\n\nInteresting example! During the pandemic, private airlines required you to show your vaccination status to be able to board the plane. Also, relevant to your earlier alcohol scenario, airlines are allowed to deny pregnant women (depending on what stage the pregnancy is in) from flying, or requiring a medical certificate saying they're fit to fly! This is both because they could enter labor in the air, or because the chances of a deep vein thrombosis are higher when pregnant."

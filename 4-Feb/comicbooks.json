And for those to have maximum impact you might want to take in the relevant issues of the preceding volumes. I'll toss together a pretty extensive list below that captures most of what you need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* HoX/PoX\n* X-Men (Vol. 5) 1, 6, 20\n* S.W.O.R.D 1, 3\n* Way of X 1-2\n* Hellfire Gala 2020 (Marauders 21, X-Men 21, Planet-Size, S.W.O.R.D. 6, Way of X 3)\n* X-Men (Vol. 6) 1-3\n* Way of X 4-5 + Onslaught  Revelation\n* S.W.O.R.D. 9-11\n* X-Men (Vol.6) 5-8\n* Inferno 1-4\n* X Lives 1\n* X Deaths 1-4\n* X Lives 5\n* X Deaths 5\n* X-Men (Vol. 6) 9\n* Immortal X-Men 1-3\n* Legion of X 1-2\n* X-Men Red 1-3\n* Legion of X 4-5\n* X-Men (Vol. 6) 10-12\n* Hellfire Gala 2022 + Amazing Spider-Man 9\n* X-Men Red 4\n* Immortal X-Men 4\n* A.X.E (specifically Immortal 7, Death to the Mutants 5, JD 6 - but they won't make sense without reading the full event. Further, Red 6>JD 4>Red 7>Legion 6 is one of the strongest run of issues since HoX/PoX, so might as well enjoy the whole thing.)\n* X-Men Red 8-10\n* Legion of X 7-10\n* Immortal X-Men 8-10\n* Sins of Sinister\n\nThat's 65 issues in addition to HoX/PoX and A.X.E. But that will certainly give you everything you need for both the current Orchis narrative and the Sins of Sinister event.\n\nThere are other Orchis plots ongoing that I've not included. Doc Barrington went from New Mutants to Children of the Atom to Sabretooth and the Exiles (independent for the first two, then with Orchis for the latter). But for Exiles to hit hardest you need to read the preceding Sabretooth mini. And for that to hit it's best to have read Hellions and Trial of Magneto.   \nSteve Orlando is laying his own through line with Judas Traveller and Orchis that begins with the Thunderbird one-shot, continues in Unlimited Infinity 45, and then into his Marauders 6, but who knows if it becomes relevant.   \nAnd there's the super-fun back-up one-shot in Weapon Plus: World War IV featuring Brute Force, plus Shammas' X-Force Annual which is really less Orchis and more Percy's Beast being a dick."

      "author": "WarWolf343",

I think it was a mix of people being tired of the same writer and feeling misled with the whole wedding not happening that led to it falling and King being kicked off the book. Can't believe I blanked on that. \n\nSame thing would happen towards the end of Slott's run as well, with *ASM* falling outside the top fifteen a few times. If a run is long enough, I think you will see reader fatigue start to kick in. But the moment a new writer comes in, you almost always see a jump in sales that last quite some time.   \n\nHowever, it should be noted that by July of 2019 *Batman* was only behind *House of X* #1, *Powers of X* #1, *ASM* #25, *The Walking Dead*, and *Batman: The Last Knight on Earth*. #1s and #25s tend to sell very, very well, and iirc, *The Walking Dead* was reaching its endgame around that time, so it's sales improved, while *The Last Knight on Earth* was a mini by Snyder, so it was always going to sell well. Meanwhile, *Immortal Hulk* dropped from the 7 spot in June to the 20 spot. \n\nBooks like *Batman* and *ASM* remain far more consistent than other books and always sell high numbers.   \n\nSide note: it should be noted that *ICv2*'s methodology in inherently flawed. It uses a non randomized set of one hundred and twenty five stores, when they should be using three hundred randomized stores. But since DC and Marvel stopped using Diamond, we lost access to their sales data which means that *ICv2*'s numbers are all we got. So it is possible that other books frequently outsell *ASM* and *Batman*, but I think that list would be very short.     \n\nFor the most part, *ASM* and *Batman* remain in the top spots with the current data we have (and even with the Diamond data they were usually Marvel and DC's best selling books). With any luck, *ICv2* will be able to get access to more stores point of sale data for a more complete picture."

Not to mention that using the same stores over and over again means that the customers tend to remain the same and that means they will are more likely to keep picking up the same books.   \n\n> Saying a book retains readers just from name recognition puts too little agency into the hands of the consumer.  \n\nBut name recognition matters a lot. *Batman* and *ASM* are fairly consistent while other books can fluctuate wildly.  \n\n*If* we see a drop in *ASM*'s numbers, I think it will happen after the whole \"what did Peter do?\" things is revealed. If fans don't like what they read, I think you will see it fall. I wouldn't be surprised if that is why fans keep reading it: the whole mystery box angle."

So the fourth arc will focus on the \"what did Peter do?\" stuff, so expect those issues to sell *very* well.

Then there is Guy Gardner, who\u2019s wearing form fitting black pants that I swear could be jeans, and he\u2019s wearing a New York style Leather Jacket-Vest. Heck, even the white gloves works well with his attire. When he was a Red Lantern, maaaaan did that Jacket look amazing.\n\nAnd THEN COMES JO walking down the isle like a fucking bawler. This is the type of Green Lantern stuff I want to see, each uniform being unique to the user and reflective of their true image. Imagine Hal flying around in a GL suit that looks more like a Fighter Pilots, or Kyle Reiner running around in a constantly changing suit to reflect his constant desire for creativity. Jon Stewart wearing that damn fine fire looking Trench Coat from the DCAU, rocking some shades, got that Blade look going on with tints of green on the outline/lining. Be wearing combat boots, got the Green Lantern Oath and sigil tattooed on his biceps from the GL ring. Black and green muscle shirt, full grown beard, shaved head with a scar on it. \n\nDude Jessica Cruz\u2019s outfit is pretty damn fine as it is, I\u2019d just add a bunch of belts and pouches. One of the pouches could be where she keeps an emergency case of anxiety medication (I still fucking love we have a Lantern with GAD. I mean, holy shit that is so freaking amazing, especially since it is a Green Lantern and GLs are all about overcoming their emotions including fear and anxiety.) and probably like snacks or something. What, I liked that scene where Simon and Jessica just eat pancakes together. I think Jessica would want to recreate that feeling of sharing a meal with your buddy, especially when suffering from an anxiety attack. She could share it with other GLs or people she\u2019s helping out. Omg I now want that as a comic.\n\nSimon: Honestly same thing I have with Jessica I have with Simon. There\u2019s not much I would do to change his outfit outside of maybe have his outfit incorporate some of his Lebanese Heritage, and maybe have it look a bit like a NASCAR driver\u2019s."

Being a variation doesn\u2019t make them the same character. \n\nI consider all three of Garfield, Maguire, and Holland\u2019s iterations of Spider-Men to be different characters as well. Yes they have the same name and are, as you have repeated a bazillion times, variations of the same character. But they are still completely different people. They have been through different tragic experiences of life and have responded to similar situations in different ways. Plus the actors portrayed the same  character in different ways. \n\nTobey and Garfield never fought with and learned from other superheroes, and neither Tobey or Holland experienced the tragic heartbreak of losing the woman they loved. Fuck, only Holland lost Aunt May.  Those differences separate them from each other and make them their own characters\n\nYou keep saying that they are all variations of the same person, and I kind of see where your coming from.

But if you can rewrite reality, what is a god to you?\n\nI will definitely check that post out, I've saved it to give it a proper read when I have some time, can see how much effort was put into that, very impressive, love seeing all the covers together like that too.\n\nReminds me that I still have Monsters sitting unread in my pile.

So that might've been the original inspiration, probably two of the earliest superheroes with powers tied to nuclear energy...\n\nHaven't gotten to **MONSTERS** yet either, usually have my hands full just keeping up with floppies so bigger books and collections tend to sit around a while before I get to 'em. And it's kinda nice having this massive BWS book waiting in the wings as something to look forward to... But I should probably just read it."

About a quarter of the way through the Squadron Supreme by Gruenwald and Hall omnibus. Then perhaps MONSTERS, or the Ennis Hellblazer omnibus."

Another good one is, \"Books Of Magic,\" read it after, \"Sandman,\" not before.\n\nIt's a little bit more mainstream but I would also read, \"Crisis On Infinite Earths,\" if you haven't already.\n\nIn fact I would read, \"Sandman,\" and then, \"Crisis On Infinite Earths,\" and then, \"Books Of Magic.\" \"Books Of Magic,\" is a spin-off of, \"Sandman,\" they're both written by Neil Gaiman they are both amazing. \"The Books Of Magic,\" does have a little bit more to do with DC Comics continuity however, and a good way to get to know the basics in one easy book is \"Crisis On Infinite Earths.\"You by no means need to read, \"Crisis On Infinite Earths,\" to enjoy either of the other two, but, 'Crisis,' is in and of itself incredibly good; probably one of the two best things to ever come out of DC Comics.(*not including vertigo*)\n\n\nSome other must reads are the Grant Morrison runs of Animal Man and Doom Patrol.(Read the animal man ones first)\n\nOh! If you like, \"Sweet Tooth,\" you will probably like, \"Y- the Last Man.\"\n\nEveryone else seems to really like the old, \"Swamp Thing,\" runs, I personally have a lot of trouble getting into those, however, \"Swamp Thing Vs. Batman,\" is truly good.\n\nIf you read, \"Preacher,\" you'll like, \"HellBlazer,\" which is a Constantine run. I'll admit I haven't read it yet but I do love Constantine and everyone keeps insisting that I read, \"Hellblazer.\"\n\nIf you've made it this far I can also suggest, \"Hitman.\" It's a little lighter than the other titles and it's another title where you'll probably want to know a little bit about the DC universe. It is a vertigo book though but Kyle Rainer is in it. This is the book where the section-8 team was introduced as well as the infamous anti-hero, The Dog Welder.(*though neither takes part heavily in the story*)\n\nAnd last but not least but *definitely last*(*because if I had said it first I would have lost all credibility*) is \"Marvel Zombies.\" Believe it or not this is a really good series. It starts off as a cheap misdirect filler miniseries in the ultimate universe turns into a weird crossover with the ape universe before finally becoming a filler series in the main universe. Even so it manages to be really good anyway. But after that it takes off in a big way basically becoming an anthology series... Starring alternately Howard The Duck or Robot Man.\n\nAnd that's my list of what I think you'll like best. Obviously there are other more mainstream comics that I love but I think this list is what you're looking for."

It\u2019s hard to put that much edge into a children\u2019s character and not be unintentionally hilarious. It\u2019s the ultimate edgelord book from a guy who, in my opinion, usually avoids this kind of garbage. \n\nI\u2019ll just quote Alan Moore, he sums it up better than I could:\n\n\u201cI think it put far too much melodramatic weight upon a character that was never designed to carry it. It was too nasty, it was too physically violent. There were some good things about it, but in terms of my writing, it\u2019s not one of me favorite pieces. If, as I said, god forbid, I was ever writing a character like Batman again, I\u2019d probably be setting it squarely in the kind of \u201csmiley uncle period where Dick Sprang was drawing it, and where you had Ace the Bat-Hound and Bat-Mite, and the zebra Batman\u2014when it was sillier. Because then, it was brimming with imagination and playful ideas. I don\u2019t think that the world needs that many brooding psychopathic avengers. I don\u2019t know that we need any.\u201d"

He became darker due to Adams and O\u2019Neil and then ofc Frank Miller. So this was already on that path and was forming into what we know him as today. \n\nIt\u2019s not edgy\u2026 it\u2019s profound in its expression to have these dark and comical characters have meaning. Which is why it\u2019s such a beloved comic and considered one of if not the greatest comic ever. \n\nBut I\u2019m still accepting of your view if you prefer the dark but still somewhat light hearted nature but that\u2019s just not who Batman is now. For decades now Batman has been this way so at this point you\u2019re just against Batman as a whole at this point."

I just disagree with all of them. \n\nI don\u2019t think there are many (any) lists where you would see Killing Joke listed as the best comic ever. Maybe best Batman comic? I dunno. It\u2019s not in my top 50 Alan Moore comics or anything like that. \n\nI\u2019m not a Batman fan, I just like good comics.

So it makes it pretty important as a comic. \n\nThen I can see why you wouldn\u2019t like it, I\u2019m curious what Batman comics you\u2019ve read tho.

The Killing Joke isn\u2019t a comic that is often included on most best comic of all time lists unless the list is strictly superhero or Batman. \n\nI have read hundreds of Batman comics but I am not even the tiniest bit interested in Batman continuity or whatever. Dark Knight Returns, Year One and even the Long Halloween are all infinitely better than The Killing Joke just to name a few that most people are familiar with.

DKR is far more \u201csuper-hero-y\u201d lots of other superheroes make appearances, it\u2019s just an action comic which is far more appropriate for the character who is generally very shallow.\n\nDKR is a pretty standard superhero story moved to a darker setting in the future.

Hence why your Killing Joke point is off. \n\nAgain if you didn\u2019t like it, whatevs. But you denying its acclaim and acting as you\u2019re in the right for said opinion is why I\u2019m criticizing you.

He creates surveillance systems that a 90s Batman would have been horrified by.  His more modern incarnations have become increasingly violent.  He\u2019s depicted frequently as alone and miserable.\n\nForge has built armor out of living mutants without their consent.  He operates on xforce to kill people.\n\nMr fantastic created a prison in the negative zone for superheroes who didn\u2019t register and makes plans for the whole world without their agreement in the Illuminati.\n\nLike\u2026 I know these things are normal now but taking a step back\u2026 those are pretty consistent negative connotations associated with intelligence.  I agree the extremes aren\u2019t good but there really aren\u2019t that many good examples of intelligence in plot lines lately.

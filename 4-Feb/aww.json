Because I recognize that humans have evolutionary reasons to 'love' each other, but knowing the evolutionary basis for my love for others doesn't make that love less real to me. I know for a fact my cat does not only love me for food lmao, I wasn't his sole provider when he was adopted and he knew that. And he still chose to cuddle up on my sweaty armpits. Maybe it's because biologically he liked my scent, maybe it's because I kind of act like a Big Hairless Cat, maybe he could sense that I would give my entire life up for him without blinking. I don't care. You could do the same amount of thinking for Human Love and still end up at- I don't care why, it's just nice that they love me. *That* was the point of me comparing 'emotions' to 'biological drive'. They're basically the same imo, seeing as people who have PhDs in this crap still can't agree on where our cuddly lovey hormones come from lmfao"

I guess we\u2019re suckers do a cat in need of a place to call its own."

I started training him because he seemed to sense if my body was going nuts and he had the perfect personality for service work. The more I worked with him, the better he became at sensing issues before they happened. He did all the groundwork work himself!\n\nHe's a rescue too, so it's a \"who rescued who\" situation. I never adopted him with the intention of him doing the work he does... but he loves it! I think he'd be bored if he didn't have his job to do, and he's singlehandedly allowed me to go places without my wheelchair, barring very long outings.\n\nI know I'm gushing, but he's incredible. Training him was the best decision I've ever made - for both of us."

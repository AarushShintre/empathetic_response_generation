It affects your behaviors, your treatment of others, and your general approach to life. Same goes with politics. Nothing you believe regarding either of those topics is in a bubble\u2014it's all important.\n\nThe thing about religion is that it hinges on faith and belief. As a religious person, and I would hazard as to guess that you have a belief in some kind of Abrahamic religion, probably some form of Christianity based on your responses, you probably understand that one of the challenges you have to face is that you must have *faith* in something that is not always made immediately clear to you. The very fact that much of your religion is scientifically unproven and baseless outside of cultural legend is one of the challenges you need to reconcile with as a believer. I'm not invalidating your beliefs with that statement, it's just a matter of fact and is literally something that is said by religious leaders in communities like yours. I speak from experience here.\n\nThe person you're replying to who said that these circumstances challenge their belief and overpower their willingness to believe in an all-loving God is valid and important to them. It doesn't necessarily automatically influence or invalidate your beliefs. The only thing that does that is looking at their argument and dismissing it wholesale without allowing it to challenge your understanding of your religion and approach it with deeper reflection and empathy.\n\nAdditionally, the Problem of Evil is one of the most basic criticisms of the concept of an all-loving God, and if an all-loving God is a key component of what you believe and you want to be honest and confident in yourself and those beliefs, then you need to be prepared to face those arguments."

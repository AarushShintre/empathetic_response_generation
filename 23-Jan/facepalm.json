Why not, why are only right wingers doing this shit so often after COVID vaccines... but not after COVID itself. Then bringing up a story about a supposed cousin who had myocarditis, wow, how convenient. \n\nYou're saying you have a side effect from a vaccine, I asked what your point was. What do you think that is a counter point to, where did I say vaccines had no side effects, where am I contradicting myself?\n\n>I think y'all are just trying to attack his character since y'all cannot attack his argument, but that is not how the world works. People's hurt feelings are irrelvant to objective reality.\n\nFirstly and this will be important, elon made no argument at all. If he was making one explain it and quote where he makes that argument. Secondly YOU asked why everyone was shitting on him for having side effects to the vaccine. You're quite objectively wrong and I stated this, people weren't shitting on him for having side effects, they were shitting on him for coming across like an antivaxer prick. \n\nI attacked YOUR argument because you were objectively wrong and your feelings about that don't matter."

(I'll add this in to help you, show me proof that he had severe side effects from the vaccine shot, AND post me evidence his cousin had myocarditis, or these things are not actually facts, they are just claims he made that are unverified. He did NOT claim vaccines have side effects which is a fact, you said this, unprompted because no one is making the argument that they don't).\n\nSEcondly, no one said he was wrong about vaccine side effects, so what is your point in stating that vaccines have side effects.\n\nThat would usually be a response to say someone claiming that vaccines don't have side effects for instance, can you see me claim they don't have side effects? So again, what is your point. You've quoted your statement again, what I asked for was the point of posting that. \n\nLets say I randomly say mid discussion, the sky is blue. You ask me what the point of me saying the sky is blue. Me saying \"the sky is blue\" isn't the answer to what is the reason for me posting that comment.\n\nUsing words you don't understand like cognitive dissonance, to make a failed point that makes no sense because you infact still have not stated what the point of saying what you did was, just makes you sound like another incredibly bad debate bro who generally doesn't understand the basics of how debates of discussions work. Repeating what you said isn't telling me the point or reason you stated it.

Money is a good thing. If you want to buy new things, new rockets, instead of keep doing the same thing over, then it's gonna cost more money. And other things need more money too. So having achieved what the president wanted us to do, and then what thousands, millions of people in America, and millions of people around the world...

What this person said has nothing to do with weather people 200 years from now will have a more advanced understanding of the world.  \n\nAlso \u201cscience\u201d of the past that is now seen as ridiculous is largely due to not following a process and proving/disproving claims.  For instance a lot of \u201cmedical\u201d treatments were just somebody thought something would work and they just started using the treatment. No study was being done, no evidence to support the treatment; so bloodletting was a common treatment and if they had done actual experiments they would have seen this was detrimental. \n\nAnd saying that people of the past are just laughed upon for their lack of scientific ability and understanding of the world is way off.  People of the past laid all of the ground work of our understanding of the world today.  The scientific world doesn\u2019t laugh at Archimedes, Galileo, Sir Isaac Newton, or Pythagoras.  Many people are still in awe at achievements of the ancient world, the things they discovered, the things they built, the things they accomplished. And they didn\u2019t have computers or even calculators to help them.  The science of the future is only possible because of the progress that has been made in our time.  And the people of the future will have a better understanding of the world unless the knowledge that currently exists is destroyed or suppressed\n\nScience isn\u2019t a belief system. It is merely based on evidence that either supports or doesn\u2019t support a conclusion.  Science is reproducible.  The reason religion is often at odds with science is that \u201cgod\u201d (for many religious people) is the explanation for all we don\u2019t understand, so as science advances and we understand more and more than \u201cgod\u201d becomes diminished.  Another reason religions are at odds with science is that religion is based on belief and if a belief is proven to be incorrect it diminishes their authority.  So when Galileo discovered that the earth revolves around the sun it challenged the authority of the church.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you lack the open mindedness to advance your knowledge and understanding of the world.

But yes, while some people (myself included) do use \u201cit/its\u201d pronouns, that number is very small, and choosing those pronouns is often in response of reclamation to feeling dehumanized for their queerness. If you want to use neutral terms for someone, use they/them/theirs until they state they\u2019d prefer otherwise. And in this case, I guess, thank you for trying to use neutral pronouns. \n\nRegarding the tiktok itself, there\u2019s a running gag on lgbtq tiktok about being assumed straight. Especially in the realm of this trend, it is a joke. This person isn\u2019t actually having a breakdown over getting a \u201cstraight flag\u201d. They\u2019re overreacting to entertain their audience in the spirit of the \u201chow dare you assume I\u2019m straight\u201d joke. While there seems to be an issue on the app with young people particularly latching too hard onto mini trends and behavior in an effort to \u201clook queer enough\u201d, this video, in my opinion, does not fit the theme of the sub."

But in this case, what happens if you don\u2019t believe, is there not a consequence?\n\nThere's a reaction for every action. That much is logical. But denying God, in and of itself, isn't what brought the consequence. The cause-and-effect in this situation is: choosing God means you save yourself from the consequences after death due to your wrongdoings. Not choosing God just leaves you where you already were; on the road to hell after death.\n\nI suppose the best analogy would be whether you would want insurance or not. In this case, it's afterlife insurance. The cost? Just some QoL improvements. It's not inherently difficult, but any idea is not without a fierce opposition. There lies the rub."

Hell is gonna be absolute torture, but not in the form of hellfire and torment like some might believe. My take is it's either Annihilationism, or another world that's without God's influence in it. Eternal separation. A world where every sinful whim, from tyranny to oppression will run rampant unchecked and unchallenged. And always changing hands. If you've ever watched Hazbin Hotel on YouTube, I'd say that's a close example of this image. There's no sense of freedom there, cause everyone will want to take it from others. There's only fear and greed.\n\nHeaven is limitless possibilities. And freedom depends on what we're capable of. To soar like eagles? To never hunger or feel pain? All without our world's property of Time? Oh, the freedom we'll have.  New creatures, new worlds, and a New Jerusalem. Ours to rule with God. And angels to help out as well.

You are saying to let 640k elderly people die, because protecting them requires a larger community response than just targeted vaccination. No matter how you look at it, herd immunity as the only solution kills a lot of people along the way, and you haven\u2019t acknowledged that even once. \n\nWhen you reference the mortality rate, you are missing the fact that it is a highly infectious virus. When millions of people get infected, 2% is a pretty big deal. Percentages aren\u2019t meaningful if you don\u2019t acknowledge the absolute numbers they are made from. And no matter how many times you point to the fact that the elderly have a higher death rate, you still have to answer for why it is ok to let the elderly die, and you still have to answer for what you would have done about the 25% who are not elderly. \n\nAnd I\u2019ll acknowledge the difference between your ABC data and my GoodRx link. ABC is more up to date, but includes a time frame when more than 70% of adults are vaccinated. The difference between current data and data from when the virus was having the largest effect comes directly from the success of vaccines in all populations. The reason it went from 25% deaths under 65 to 10% in that age group is because that age group is vaccinated. I have no problem acknowledging the success of vaccines, but if you want to argue for herd immunity as the only solution, you have to consider data from when vaccination rates were much lower. Or accept the fact that the vaccines worked. \n\n\n\n>you\u2019re stating speculations\n\nNo, I am referring to real, existing cases of long Covid. I am referring to the known and serious impacts people have had after a Covid infection.  Actual cases that are in hospitals. Not speculation.  \n\nWhat is speculation is that there will be some sort of long term effect of the vaccine. This hasn\u2019t been shown, and although you are right it may in the future, it is not likely considering long term effects of a vaccine that is out of the system in a matter of weeks isn\u2019t a common result. So we can look to vaccine history to see how many vaccines produced long term results long after the short time frame we have had to study. This is an extremely low number, making your suggestion speculation. \n\n>you do your best with what is in the tool shed\n\nYes, that is why all age groups get vaccinated. Just vaccinating the elderly would not produce the level of community immunity needed to protect them, unless we decide to just let hundreds of thousands of people die before we get there. \n\n>1.8 mortality \n\nYou are forgetting that 1.8% is well over a million people.  A million dead people is a lot, no matter what percentage you put on that. \n\nYou are also forgetting that the low mortally rate is due to the 70%+ vaccination rate among all populations, and that rate was much higher before vaccines were this wide spread."

      "body": ">If you think I said rely on herd immunity only then you aren\u2019t reading what I\u2019m saying.\n\nBut you are, though. If your claim is that people (other than the elderly) should not get vaccinated because you want to wait for herd immunity, then you are accepting all of the deaths that are required to reach that point. And that includes the additional elderly deaths that happen because the rest of society keeps spreading the disease at a rate higher than an individual vaccination can protect. You are suggesting we let those people die, so that you don't have to do anything yourself to help prevent it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I don\u2019t post something like it\u2019s 25% when it\u2019s not to boost narrative.\n\nI want to be very clear on this point, so you don't misunderstand. I gave you the data that shows 25% of covid deaths were in people under 65. You can see it yourself. The difference is, this data is from a time when there were fewer vaccinations, which is a world you are advocating for. You have given updated data including the last two years, where only 10% of the deaths have been in people under 65. This is a world where the vast majority of the population is vaccinated. \n\nThat improvement is BECAUSE people are vaccinated. If you want to argue that letting people just get infected, rather than vaccinated, you have to look at the data that comes from the time period where that was happening more than it is today. \n\nSo you need to choose which narrative you want? \"Mass vaccination is effective, and reduced the death rate for people under 65 from 25% to 10%\"? Or \"Only the elderly need to be vaccinated, and everyone else should just get infected to create a herd immunity, so that 25% of the deaths will be people under 65\"? Which one is your preferred stance here?\n\n>With regard to the elderly dying, they should take the vaccine seeing as how it reduces their chance of hospitalization. \n\nUnfortunately, the vaccine is less effective in preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death in elderly people with weaker immune systems. Protecting them requires both their own vaccination, and a community around them that wants to stem the spread of the virus. \n\n>Never said anything about how people shouldn\u2019t take it. Shouldn\u2019t be forced either.\n\nNobody was forced to get the vaccination. There may have been groups and associations that require their members (or employees) to be vaccinated, but nobody was ever forced into that voluntary association. Nobody is owed a life of convenience at other's expense. If you don't like the requirements of a given association, then you move on freely and without coercion. But no association should be forced to risk the health and safety of their members because some people don't like those requirements. \n\n\"Force\" implies \"no choice\". You always have a choice. 30% of the US population has chosen to not be vaccinated. Nobody forced them to do anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>like I said before of course there is no data on vaccine side effects because they aren\u2019t doing nor are they attempting to. If they did it\u2019d take 5-10 years.\n\nof course. So you are speculating about side effects you have no evidence of, and disregarding the fact that there are few (if any) examples of prior vaccinations that have produced long term effects down the road that didn't show up in the beginning. You are also ignoring the fact that the vaccine itself leaves the system in a matter of weeks, so you are making the assumption that the body will just one day decide to have an issue because of an external factor that is no longer there.   \n\n\nBut you know what we DO have data on? Long term effects of Covid infection. We have people, right now, who are suffering under debilitating conditions caused by Covid infections that have long past. I'm just saying we should talk about what is real, and not what you need to invent to make an anti-vax claim. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And once again, stop making stuff up. Here\u2019s a link clearly stating how unvaccinated are the 1.7 Those vaccinated are at .22 No matter how you see it, unvaccinated or not it\u2019s still under 1.8 percent and that is actually 12 years and older. If it was 49 and below the stats would be even smaller in youth.\n\nYou mean the article with this detail right in the header?  \n\n\n>The death rate among unvaccinated people is still far higher than that among the vaccinated even though vaccinated people now make up a significant proportion of deaths\n\nWhat I am trying to say to you, and which you still haven't acknowledged, is that percentages don't mean much if you don't understand the absolute value. 1.7 deaths per 100,000 people, over an extended period of time, is a lot of dead people. These are the people you continually support just letting die, while you wait for herd immunity to kick in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd as for herd immunity, you should understand that vaccination is part of that. Natural herd immunity, caused only by infection, would not likely be able to outpace the spread of the virus. Mild or asymptomatic infections do not produce the immune response, so only the people who have had serious infections have any part to play in natural herd immunity. So when you remove all the asymptomatic and mild infections from your number, and just rely on the serious infections you need to create your natural herd immunity, your death rate skyrockets. \n\nThe only effective path to herd immunity is mass vaccination, along with natural immunity. The combination of those two things is the only thing that is going to actually address the ongoing issue."

So stop repeating the same talking point. \nAs far as it goes with transmission, Covid isn\u2019t effective against transmission we all know that, believe you acknowledged that earlier but it does help with the effects Covid has on this with pre existing conditions or respiratory issues etc.\n\nI specifically showed you the mortality rate of Covid which has stood under 2.0%, 1.8 being the highest in America. I\u2019m not going to give your repeated talking point any play, that\u2019s not what I said. Covid vaccines do not stop fully stop with transmission, just effects with those who have respiratory issues, elderly etc. Once again Covid vaccinations are complicated when it comes to transmission because Covid is airborne.\n\nSo mandates that came out, giving the options of quitting, be fired or getting the vaccine is the only way to keep your job isn\u2019t forceful?\n\nNobody should have to get the vaccine if they don\u2019t want to, simple. If I had the flu and didn\u2019t get the flu vaccine that\u2019s my decision, I could spread it get others sick but that\u2019s my irresponsible choice. \n\nThere has been documented evidence of people who have died and/or got effected by the vaccine & no the cdc specifically stated how they do not know where the spike protein is stored and that will play a role in years to come, hopefully not. But that may not be studied nor will we have the data if they lock up the data for 75 years so yeah that is very sketchy as well.\n\nI am not anti bad, I\u2019m simply stated if you want to take it, take it but if not then don\u2019t simple.\n\nThat same data is on the cdc website, which I provided earlier.\n\nIdk how you get 1.7 % deaths per 100,000 is low. I don\u2019t care how you see it, it\u2019s a low amount of people compared to the rest of the world. If 1.7 % of the world was too cold would you heat up the earth and say 99.3% deal with it? \n \nA study on the unvaccinated v the vaccinated\n\nhttps://connect.uclahealth.org/2022/01/20/natural-immunity-vs-vaccine-induced-immunity-to-covid-19/\n\nA study published Feb. 3 in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that natural antibodies from COVID-19 infection may last as long as 20 months. Experts caution, however, that these antibodies may not provide immunity from reinfection. It is yet to be determined how much natural immunity is needed to prevent infection.\n\nIt all depends on the symptoms you develop once you get Covid, if you\u2019re elderly or have existing issues, especially respiratory you can be effected quite significantly. Regardless vaccinations don\u2019t fully stop transmission but help if you have the existing issues."

      "body": ">Are you seriously ignoring my statements on purpose? I said those that Covid would hurt the most.\n\nNo, I hear you. But those that Covid hurts the most is \\*checks data from this very thread\\* everyone. Unless, of course, you think there is a group of people who it is ok to sacrifice for the benefit of others. Without the vaccine, 25% of the covid deaths were people under the age of 65. So unless you can explain how the quarter of a million people under age 65 that have died weren't hurt by Covid, I am just taking your words at their implications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As far as it goes with transmission, Covid isn\u2019t effective against transmission we all know that,\n\nThis is false. It isn't 100% effective, but that is not the same as 0% effective, as you have claimed here. The vaccines were far more effective for Alpha and Delta than they are for Omicron, but since the anti-vax narratives you are repeating were there during Alpha and Delta, we can consider that effectiveness in our discussion. With the caveat that Omicron reduces this effectiveness to some extent.\n\nThe vaccine helps to prevent infection. It isn't 100%, and the Omicron effectiveness is even less, but neither are 0%.\n\nWhere the vaccine doesn't prevent infection, it can reduce the length of the infection, which reduces the duration that the infection can be spread from an infected person. This also helps prevent the spread.\n\nAnd even when an infection does break through, the vaccine reduces the severity and reduces the number of hospitalizations and death. This happens in ALL age groups, which would mean it is effective for all age groups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>but it does help with the effects Covid has on this with pre existing conditions or respiratory issues etc.\n\nActually, it helps everyone, regardless of preexisting conditions. Preexisting conditions were not a requirement for serious illness or death. This has impacted people of all classifications, and people from all classifications are benefitted from cooperative effort.\n\n>I specifically showed you the mortality rate of Covid which has stood under 2.0%,\n\nBut you didn't explain why you don't care about the large number of people that make up that 2%, or why you only concern yourself with death, and not serious illness and long Covid. I have brought that up each time you brought up 2%, but you keep disregarding it. How many people would have to die before you would accept that just waiting for natural immunity isn't the best plan?\n\n>Covid vaccines do not stop fully stop with transmission, just effects with those who have respiratory issues, elderly etc.\n\nThat's the key. \"Fully\". just because it isn't 100%, doesn't mean it is 0%. The vaccine absolutely does prevent transmission- just not at 100%. And Covid does not just affect those with respiratory issues or elderly. That is a false claim, and ignores all of the people who have died that don't fall into that category. It is the fact that each of your arguments require ignoring a certain set of deaths and/or severe illness to make any sense that suggests to me you are just ok with some people dying who don't have to. At the very least, you seem to be ok with elderly people or people with preexisting conditions dying, because each of your arguments dismiss them as collateral damage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So mandates that came out, giving the options of quitting, be fired or getting the vaccine is the only way to keep your job isn\u2019t forceful?\n\nCorrect. Voluntary association is voluntary. Nobody is forced to associate with a group that has requirements they do not wish to meet. And no group should be forced to accept a risk to their associates simply because some other people don't want to meet those requirements. Everything is a choice.\n\nForce implies no choice at all. If people were forced to be vaccinated, then there wouldn't be 30% of the population who aren't. Nobody owes you a convenience, and you can't claim the loss of that convenience equals force. Everyone has choices, and each choice has its impacts. That doesn't make it not a choice.\n\n>Nobody should have to get the vaccine if they don\u2019t want to, simple.\n\nAnd nobody does. The 30% unvaccinated in the US prove this point.\n\n>There has been documented evidence of people who have died and/or got effected by the vaccine\n\nYes, documented, but in extremely low numbers. Low absolute numbers, and very low percentage-wise (as that is the metric you prefer). And even in the subset of adverse reactions, nearly all of them have been mild. The overall number of serious adverse reactions to the vaccine are no higher than with any other vaccine or other type of medicine in existence. You can have an adverse reaction to Tylenol.\n\n>the cdc specifically stated how they do not know where the spike protein is stored and that will play a role in years to come\n\nCan you source this claim? Are you aware that the spike protein is a feature of the virus itself? If there were some expected mystery response to spike proteins in the future, how do you separate that from the ones that come from infection?\n\n[https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/spike-protein-behavior](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/spike-protein-behavior)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I don\u2019t care how you see it, it\u2019s a low amount of people compared to the rest of the world.\n\nYou mean low compared to some other parts of the world. It is also high compared to other parts of the world. But this isn't about relativity. It is about absolute numbers. How many deaths are acceptable, as long as they remain under some other relative amount? If it were 5 million dead, would that still be ok, just as long as 10 million died somewhere else? Where do you draw the line?\n\n>If 1.7 % of the world was too cold would you heat up the earth and say 99.3% deal with it?\n\nIf 1.7% of our population died from being too cold, yes, I would consider handing out blankets. But your analogy fails because giving someone who isn't cold a blanket isn't going to help someone who is, but giving someone who isn't in a high risk category for Covid a vaccine WILL help those who are.\n\nFrom [your linked study](https://connect.uclahealth.org/2022/01/20/natural-immunity-vs-vaccine-induced-immunity-to-covid-19/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Vaccine-induced immunity allows an individual to experience protection against severe illness from COVID-19 **without first being sickened by the virus.**\n\n**Infection-induced immunity may depend on the severity of illness,** says Shangxin Yang, PhD, a clinical microbiologist at UCLA Health. Early studies found that people who were infected with COVID-19 but were **asymptomatic or exhibited only mild symptoms mounted a less-robust antibody response.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Is immunity from natural infection with COVID-19 better than vaccine-induced immunity?\n\nA: Experts say no, because the **risks associated with COVID-19 infection are far less predictable than the** **SMALL** **risks associated with the vaccine.** Infection with COVID-19 can lead to viral spread, serious illness and death. COVID-19 vaccines produce generally mild side effects that last a few days at most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Still, the authors maintain that vaccination is the best way to protect against COVID-19 infection, long-term complications, hospitalization and death.\n\nWas there something I was supposed to get from that which supported your argument?\n\n>Regardless vaccinations don\u2019t fully stop transmission but help if you have the existing issues.\n\nAgain, not \"fully\". not being 100% does not mean 0%. And vaccines are equally effective for people who don't have preexisting conditions. Pre-existing conditions are not a requirement for serious Covid illness."

I feel like I have stated that over and over again, in multiple different variations. So what I would like to know is two things.\n\nHave you really not understood those words when I have said them, to the point you believe this statement that I just posted?\n\nDo you really believe that nobody other than elderly or people with preexisting conditions have been affected by Covid?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I showed you the fatality rate of those vaccinated those non vaccinated and that is still relatively small.\n\nDo you understand the difference between rate and absolute numbers?

Here, you will see there are lots of countries that have a lower fatality rate than the US. In fact, the US is 15th highest of 154 countries. And Mexico? Well that is 30th on that list. So much for your Mexico theory.\n\n>Pretty simple, as well as you didn\u2019t post how the natural immunity lasts longer than the vaccine.\n\nActually, I did.

Heck, the writer even began a paragraph by pointing out that Biden's approval rating was well below 50% for more than a year.\n\nAt the end of the article, where his plans are listed and highlighted in red or green, along with an \"x\" or checkmark, to show whether he's accomplished those things or not, are in no particular order. In fact, six of the first seven (and three of the last four) items listed can be called \"failures\" by Biden (thus in red with an \"x\"), and therefore help disprove your accusation of bias by the writer.\n\nI'm getting the feeling you don't like Biden, which is fine (I lean left but I'm not a fan, either), and feel like the writer isn't highlighting things he has failed to do enough.

When you need to move heavy things like cattle, crops, and equipment over rough terrain, long distances, or steep inclines, the batteries run down quickly, leaving them stranded with a heavy load. Many of the federal law makers, representing states with multiple highly populated cities and more available services along roadways forget to take rural areas into account when passing laws. It's frustrating, especially with the increasing demand for plant based foods, that they don't stop to think about what it takes to produce the food.  Farmers and ranchers often do have the small electric ATV's to use around the farm, but fossil fuel is needed, for now. Also, much of our electricity still comes from coal and natural gas. Solar is not a total solution, either because it's eating up farmland, has a high fire risk, the mining process for the substances used in the batteries is pretty scary, and chemicals from the batteries can leak into the soil. Wind power is better but it still won't replace fossil fuel."

I've ever heard about it, or seen it on signage. In my son's school on the calendar that lists observed holidays, it isn't on there. I guess what I'm asking is what is your point here?"

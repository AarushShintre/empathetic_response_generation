This is the only major one I know of where you can do anything and everything, you'll never be locked out of something because of a decision you made in the past. Imagine if it was a class-based system like WoW and you picked the mage class at the beginning so now you can't level att/str/range past 60 or something and you just forever suck at the other styles. People would justify it like \"oh you aren't bad at melee you're just good at mage\" but coming from a system where you could theoretically swap between absolute max gear and styles in a single game tick it would feel like you're locked out of a lot of the game. I understand why those systems exist in other games but I'm glad OSRS isn't like that. \n\nI think they kind of tried to do it when they launched Zeah, you'd lose favor in the other houses when you gained it for one and there wasn't a way to lock it at 100%. It fuckin sucked, idk if it's just not a good idea for OSRS or if the implementation was bad but Jagex changed it pretty quick because it wasn't fun and ultimately just meant that you had to re-grind favor every time you wanted a perk from a different house and everyone hated it."

Outside of raids, most bosses don't have high enough defense to where the DWH is going to reduce defense enough. Sire and KQ are the only ones I can think of where DWH is better because defense is so high, you'd have to hit very high with BGS to reduce defense by an equal amount to DWH.\n\nAnd in raids, BGS is almost always better where it's used. BGS is 15-20% more accurate at Maiden, Xarpus and Sote. 30% more accurate at Olm melee hand. BGS would be better at Tekton if not for a specific exception that lets DWH reduce defense by a small amount even if it whiffs. DWH is also garbage at ToA because of base defense levels.\n\nGiven you'll commonly be running teams (ToB & CoX), DWH is useful, but not because DWH is a good alternative to BGS. Because it exists to make BGS specs better. You let the DWH people spec first to reduce the high defense for bigger impact (250 defense) and then BGS users spec because the defense is lower and it will be far more effective now. This is also a problem with DWH by itself, in that follow up DWH specs suck because they're a % reduction. Unlike BGS where subsequent BGS specs improve due to the damage based reduction.\n\nDWH just sucks, frankly. Well, not \"sucks\", but it's considerably worse than BGS. Spec accuracy is really important, and DWH is just really inconsistent. But it's crazy that BGS takes a fraction of the time to get yourself or a fraction of money to buy and is so much better at almost every piece of content you want defense reduction."

If you go to bandos in a standard shaman setup you're looking at 2-3 minute kills before respawn time. You cannot seriously believe that the requirements for both are anywhere close to equivalent. Sure it is possible to get a couple of kills but please let me know how many people have ground out a bgs with a rcb with shaman tier stats.\n\nI agree dwh is inferior, it's barely relevant nowadays,but that's not necessarily a bad thing, not everything can, or should be. Should we make corp sigils a 1/100 because they're basically useless/very niche too?"

Or you would RCB kite around the room. Getting as many kills per trip is paramount to speeding up the grind, so it was a common method before bowfa existed. Mains didn't do this because they could just GWD in teams and smack Bandos with a whip or something.\n\n> Should we make corp sigils a 1/100 because they're basically useless/very niche too?\n\nNo, we shouldn't, but DWH isn't niche because what it does is a very widely used mechanic that's important for a lot of bossing content. The benefits offered by the Corp shields are niche in themselves because their usefulness is incredibly specific to specific mechanics or very specific setups.\n\nThat being said, I've never liked the idea of having hyper niche items also be really expensive just because they're great at said niche. Makes it really hard to justify that cost or time to grind it.\n\nI like Justiciar armor a lot more than Elysian, for example. It's not obscenely rare, it's 33m for the set and it reduces damage by 11-15% (depending on defensive bonuses for a variety of tank setups). And you don't lose much in terms of offensive by having Justiciar, plus it has prayer bonuses. So it's very justifiable for those specific tank setups.\n\nSacrificing a dragon/avernic defender for Elysian sacrifices much more DPS while also asking the player spend **a ton** more time and/or money to achieve results that are only 2-3% better than Justiciar."

I think the most \u201cworld-ending threat\u201d we\u2019ve had is Tombs, and we never fight the real problem there, just minions. \n\nThere definitely is potential to jump the shark though, RS3 shows that, and you\u2019re totally valid if you aren\u2019t enjoying the higher stakes quests like Mm2, Beneath Cursed Sands, etc.\nIt\u2019s also possible\n\nI\u2019ll also agree that while I think Gilenor as a world is absolutely high fantasy, if we go by that tv tropes article we do have a lot of quests that are more traditionally low fantasy stories. Aka low fantasy plots being told in a high fantasy setting, which can make the lines weird."

You're saying someone made a change to building code that causes houses to start falling. I'm saying \"no they updated that code so new houses won't have that problem\" and you're stubbornly going \"yes they will! i cant prove it but they will!\"\n\n> That is not true. It is very simply not true. \n\nCorrect. You're making up things and then dying in a hole defending them, over a meaningless and annoying update to the game.\n\n> You being able to build a bot that circumvents this, is not PROOF that an equal amount of bots are botting before and after. Is that so hard to understand?\n\nand nothing you have said is proof to the contrary. They were able to bot before, they are able to bot now. Why would the amount of people botting it **have changed** if the circumstances around the accessibility of botting it have not changed? Provide **actual reasons** not \"you cant prove it so fuck this conversation\" replies.\n\nYou won't be able to, because there is ZERO statistics on this, and even if they were as i've covered theyd likely be presented as a \"lower ban count .:. lower bot count\" when i could equally say that a slight variation to the script adds more randomness and \"human element\" to the detection making it harder than the previously SUPER OBVIOUS \"click rhythmically for hours on end with no faltering\" simple scripts that could be ran.\n\nMy \"hypothesis\" if you want one, is that bots were easier to catch before than they are now. That can result in a lower ban rate, due to a lower detection rate. Which isn't a win for us. That means more bots fly under the radar, and they're equally available at a simple search, due to the whole activity still being incredibly simple to automate, just as it was before."

Splitbark can't be compared to Ahrim's, which requires 70 attack and defence to even be worn! If Bloodbark is the slightest bit worth using, how come almost _nobody_ is wearing it? The only reason you'd choose Bloodbark over Ahrim's is for the heal, which is a really poor decision considering Ahrim's is just superior in virtually every other instance.

If I wanted def mage gear and didn't have 8m to spend I 100% would use bloodbark. Its one of the highest if not the highest defense gear for mage in the game and cheap to buy.  It is only harder to get for an ironman... which is your choice if that is what you are. It doesn't make sense to buff something that already has upgrades to it. its not used very frequently because it came out in 2021 when most people are past that stage in their accounts and new people don't even realize it exist. If you are an ironman consider the fact that while you are grinding for it you would be getting prayer xp and amulets of the damned which is as good as glory til you get higher crafting.\n\nTLDR if you want an upgrade to splitbark go and earn it/buy it. it literally already exists."

The new skill has to feel and look like OSRS, it also has to work alongside the other skills. It becomes utterly important that the new skill doesn't become some kind of meta. You shouldn't feel forced to train a skill due to it being overpowered. \n\nIf the xp rate from bookcases and harder classes are being handled carefully I don't think the balancing should be a problem. \n\nThe way it makes sense to me is that this is the end of the adventurer's career where you need to hand over the knowledge to next generation. Maybe the names I've come up with doesn't fit the OSRS theme but if  that's the case I think we as a community can come up with better ways to call the classroom and school. I still think the school and classroom theme fits because it's kind of already in the game: The random exam event and the pupils in Varrock museum are to me indicating that there is some kind of school system behind the scenes. \n\nSo the lore and the balancing will not be a problem quite the opposite actually. The Self-written books may even make some unbalanced and dead content to be revived. But I do agree that the graphics and names has to be fitting the aesthetic and runescape setting."

There are very few locations in the game that even acknowledge that other players exist outside of your character\u2019s interactions with NPC\u2019s. But most importantly, this is a skill that\u2019s built to interact with other skills primarily, and bring content second. That\u2019s the damning part. This doesn\u2019t bring any new gameplay or mechanics worth mentioning. There are items, and a mechanic, and a gameplay loop, but they\u2019re all weak, unrepeatable, and again, teaching as a concept doesn\u2019t make sense. You\u2019re not going to win me over on this.

Don't forget the theoretical classes, they are new content. Yes the practical classes may include some existing content but it may also be done in a whole different way than the regular way. It isn't written in stone how the classes is going to be done but they sure will be new content. \n\nIf you don't buy the concept that's fair enough for me, I'm glad you wrote your honest opinion.

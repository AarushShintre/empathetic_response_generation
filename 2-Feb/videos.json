AND, they would often say they never received documents and X-rays that were sent with the paper claim form. This was over 18 years ago and electronic claims were just starting. We never did electronic claims since we had to include periodontal charts and a full mouth series of X-rays for almost all claims. I learned to glue and staple the chart and X-rays to the claim form. I would have to argue with the insurance company when they tried to tell me they did not receive something. My response was: \"If you have the claim form then you have the rest since they were glued and stapled together.\n\nPlus, insurance companies hire people who know nothing about dentistry. I had one employee tell me that the area of the mouth that was treated was missing from the claim. It just happened to be a treatment code that was for individual teeth and not a quadrant procedure code. I told her the tooth numbers that were treated and indicated on the form. This idiot was processing dental claims and had no idea that adult teeth are numbered and deciduous (children's teeth are alphabetically lettered). That was an interesting conversation. I did say some things since I knew the call was being not just recorded but, monitored. Someone disconnected that call. When I called back I had choice word la for the manager of the department.\n\nThere were several insurance companies I truly hated dealing with."

Now the primary insurance had already paid so I submitted the secondary insurance claim with a copy of the EOB (Explanation of Benefits) from the primary insurance. Secondary insurance wanted X-rays before they would even consider the claim. Problem was that the treatment was a soft tissue graft and the recession of the gums does not show on an X-ray...duh! So then they wanted photos. At that time the doctor did not routinely make photos of recession since it was documented on the period chart. The insurance company insisted even though this was explained and I questioned the need for post-op photos especially since the patient was now living out of the country and not even on the same continent.

I understand why things like car models are included in that, which is all the examples you provided.\n\nI'm talking about stories where the type of car the person drives is entirely irrelevant. Anytime a Tesla is involved in anything it is mentioned that it's a Tesla, even when it's not relevant. If there was some kind of manhunt to get the guy in this story then I get it, but it's not - it's a story about the guy being arrested IN HIS TESLA. Search for road rage news stories - there's lots and the headline won't mention the type of car, unless it's a Tesla.\n\nHere is an example of the kind of news item I am talking about:\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/tesla-california-doctor-attempted-murder-charge-b2272281.html\n\nWhat relevance is it that the car was a Tesla in that story? It's a man who tried to kill his family. Why mention specifically that it was a Tesla. \n\nOnce you notice it, you'll see it a lot. News stories that aren't anything about Tesla's specifically. There are lots. I'm not going waste my time finding them for you because I don't care as much as you apparently do, but they're there and you'll notice it now I've pointed it out."

What is the significance of the kind of car he was driving?\"\n\nChanging the goal post now is a dishonest move.\n\nThe implicit relevance to the car being a Tesla is the fact that it is a company promoting and fronting the technology of autonomous (self-driving) cars.  The drivers actions were intentional and the resulting crash was not a result of the self-drive function.  Further to that, the occupants of the car survived a 250 foot fall off a cliff. This accomplishment is a testament to the cars modern technology successes in safety. Tesla won a 5-Star Euro NCAP Rating for its first in class safety. [https://insideevs.com/news/622091/2022-tesla-models-5star-euro-ncap/](https://insideevs.com/news/622091/2022-tesla-models-5star-euro-ncap/)  Furthermore, the societal class awareness of car status is a reality of media, just as white victims, minority criminals, the success of the underdogs and the failures of the rich is what helps sell \"papers\". \n\nIn short your example shows: \n\n\\- The Tesla was NOT in self-drive mode - huge implications to the company and other users. \n\n\\- The family all survived what most other car owners would not have.\n\n\\- The family is an example of what could be a classic case of schadenfreude.\n\n>I'm not going waste my time finding them for you because I don't care as much as you apparently do, but they're there and you'll notice it now I've pointed it out.\n\nDemonstrably you care more as you placed this deepity post. I am correcting your ignorance on the subject.  You demonstrated in your article that it hits all the points I laid out and fails your assumption of the irrelevance of the Car/brand at the same time."

My original point, which still stands, is that the original post/article was about a *person* with road rage who has been caught and arrested - and so is nothing to do with the car he drove.

There's thousands of them and scores of other news articles about those other road ragers - which will barely ever include the type of car in the headline, unless it's a Tesla.\n\nYou went on to give a bunch of examples of a completely different thing (news articles specifically where car models are relevant - I never said those types didn't exist) and then invented a bunch of reasons why the other example I provided makes mentioning the Tesla relevant, when the articles I found on that story did not mention those things. It was not part of the story. \n\nThere are lots and lots of examples that you'll start to notice now where inexplicably it's stated they are a \"Tesla driver\" like that is some \"type\" of person. \n\nNice straw man though, I guess it's important for you to set one up so you can feel like you \"got a win\".\n\nAnyway, enjoy your keyboard rage, it's quite funny to watch.

It sucked for women, but you\u2019re exaggerating the issues for your own agenda by insisting these traditions were rooted in arbitrarily imposed suffering. My point is even in the most well meaning of cultures, they didn\u2019t have any other choice back then. Pretending they were treated as property is an exaggeration and uses a term that is intentionally dishonest to trigger an emotional response. \n\nWomen have had it rough, but in general, were NOT viewed as or treated like property unless they were literally chattel slaves."

Their only value was in creating more humans, preferably male. People still treated their property well enough because it has value - that was true for women as well. \n\nWomen had zero rights and no say in what happened with their lives, bodies, etc, same as property. They were literally used in deals as though they were property, too. They couldn't own anything themselves - everything belonged to their husband. Literally everything about the way women were treated makes it quite clear they were viewed as property. Was it objectifying? Yes. Dehumanizing? YES. That's exactly why it was a problem (and in many ways still is today).\n\nEdit: Here is one of many, many articles on the subject.\n\nhttps://psychcentral.com/lib/women-as-property-an-existential-challenge-in-psychotherapy-part-2#10"

      "body": "It was not their only value, but it was their most important duty for the literal survival of the family, clan or village. \n\nWomen outnumbered men consistently throughout history until the modern age, sometimes as high as 10:1 because men were more willingly having their lives thrown away for war or dangerous work like mining and hunting. \n\nMen were used for deals as often as women were, which was only usually done for slave trading. The only time women were used as deals beyond that was with noble marriages for political alliances, which a vast majority of women were not. Any arranged marriages for lower classes were just as forced upon the men as they were for the women. \n\nAny of these traditions still followed today are arbitrary, but they had rational, objective reasons for them before the modern age. Everyone was dehumanized. Men and women had different issues. Men were thrown away as canon fodder, women were taken as prizes by the powerful or elite. Men had to go out and do all the risky, dangerous work, women were trapped in their small communities. \n\nIf a town was invaded by an army or bandits, the males were killed off and the females were taken as prizes. Which is worse? Again, I\u2019m not dismissing the suffering of women, and I don\u2019t think you can compare suffering like this. But my entire point is that it\u2019s far more complicated than \u201cwomen were property\u201d and \u201cmen had everything else.\u201d These families and tribes worked for the greater good of the whole unit, and part of that was women performing an actual duty for the survival of their family. There was no other choice except for abandoning your family."

There is no way that was remotely common anywhere. \n\n2) Women literally were not ALLOWED to do those jobs BECAUSE men didn't let them. You're acting like this was something women decided, but it wasn't. \n\n3) It also was the norm for women to be treated as a property exchange when they got married. They had no say in the matter for most of history, and this was true for everyone, not just nobility. \n\n4) Being treated as a \"prize\" is a perfect example of women being considered PROPERTY. Being raped and enslaved by your captor for the rest of your life isn't better than being killed, and it's disgusting you imply that it is. \n\n5) It wasn't \"necessary\" for women to have zero rights over the lives or their bodies. You're acting like women \"had\" to be treated this way in order to perpetuate the human race, but that's ridiculous and trivializes the objectively horrible experiences that women have had for nearly all of history. \n\n6) Did you read the article I linked? Or bother to Google any on your own? It was literally coded into *law* that women were property in many places. You're ignoring actual history to push this agenda that it \"wasn't that bad, and anyway men had it bad, too.\" That's blatantly false, and every single reputable resource on the subject shows otherwise. I recommend actually researching this issue before forming such strong opinions on it."

Tsundere trope: This trope always shows that the two start of with hating each other, often times their relationship is forced (Nisekoi - fake lovers, Kyo Kara Maoh - fiance by mistake) and the tsundere is usually overly jealous, controlling and abusive towards their love interest but on spending time together they get close and have a happy ending together. My parents hated each other and were forced to marry by their relatives and here's the deal, even after nearly 30 years things just don't get better, they fight all the time never agree and my mother constantly yells just like those loudmouth tsunderes. Also abusive relationship don't get better by spending time together.\n2. Assault victim ending up with their perpetrator - my father forcibly pinned me down on a sofa and tried to kill me. I remember very clearly that I was completely unable to move, he overpowered me and it was scary but mainly BL anime usually shows such a thing as romantic, the victim doesn't feel afraid, it's basically some sort of dub con where he doesn't want it but is shown to be blushing to give the image that he secretly likes it. The situation is different, it wasn't romantic in my case but it just leaves a bad after taste in my mouth and I absolutely hate seeing them get together as a couple in the end which is one of the major reasons I dislike BL"

I don't know where you got this idea that I'm talking about gain, I'm not.\n\nWhat happens if one of their members does what Leon did? A member that doesn't have a special class rune? How many people die when otherwise it would have just been one person? Would you say those are acceptable losses? This is a scenario that I'd say is very likely to happen when they give every member what is basically a bomb.\n\nThe problem is they have very little to gain from these attacks, and a whole lot more to lose. They save a town, they risk a war that would cost several more towns.\n\nHell, if they thought long-term and didn't give unstable members prism powder, they could have gotten Cyrene on their side and had an incredibly useful ally. But they don't think long-term, which as I've said several times at this point, is their biggest problem.\n\nShort-term victories are great, so long as they lead to the long-term.

They're not actively helping Highland and putting people in their hands out of some delusional hope of compassion or fighting strength.\n\nLots of assumptions to unpack here. You're assuming that Cyrene made and brought the levitation circle. We don't know how it got there, but if Cyrene doesn't have the power to destroy it, I have massive doubts that she brought it there. It just doesn't make logical sense to assume she brought the trouble there.\n\nThe more likely scenario is that she's just there to watch over it. In which case it makes no difference whether it's her or another Highlander there.\n\n>So they should let Highland kill people, because otherwise Highland might kill people ?\n\nAh yes, because a few people being raped or killed every now and then is the same as the casualties an all out war would bring. Totally the same thing, you're right. How could I be so silly.\n\nI don't understand what point you're trying to make here, I think the difference in casualties between the two is massive. Not even remotely the same.\n\nEDIT: Anyways, I'm getting quite bored with this conversation, and I don't think either of us are budging on our opinion anyways.

Its also important to say that they usually put a couple light hearted episodes as a breather, but these are important and set things up for the next story arc."

Talking in the even bigger picture, everything in life is to be determined by you and how you want to do things. But I'm not getting into that.\n\nMy point is everything to doing with rating something is always going to be opinion, even how harshly or lightly you choose to rate something. Bc it's your opinion. But coming In here saying \"yall odvisouly don't know what your doing\" seems a little.. \"suspicious\". Hmm so you mean to tell me everybody else has the wrong idea??

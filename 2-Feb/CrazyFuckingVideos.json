Environmental concerns dont help because it makes the replenishment rate slower so they cant recpver from over fishing and slowly go extinct, like the Chinook Salmon.

You have no idea what my opinion on the matter is, as I\u2019ve never stated it. All I stated was it is impossible to tell if something is being over harvested or not simply from a video of a warehouse, where volume efficiency is the main priority. A 80 thousand pound truck and trailer, the load is about 45 thousand pounds and most warehouses will get within 500 pounds of that. \n\nThe only way you can actually tell if a species of fish is being overfished is by looking at the population of the fish out in the wild, not whatever comes out of a truck, or boat."

This is what they use to stock ponds/lakes and relocate fish due to harsh spawning conditions to help survival. They also use these trucks at fish farms to transport. \n\nWhen the fish is being sold for food, they have to pack it with ice as it cannot get above a temperature. The fish are also cleaned at the plant, which is why i believe this video is boat to plant, not a truck. \n\nI think we both agree on the state of the fishery. Of course you count whats in the wild, thats why i mentioned the salmon ladder count and King Crab being shut down. \n\nIts actually pretty easy to tell when things are being overharvested with videos like this. Salmon ladders. Crab counts. GPS tags for bigger fish like whales and sharks. We just have to look."

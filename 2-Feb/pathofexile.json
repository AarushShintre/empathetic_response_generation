Assuming the base connected map rate is 30% then if it blocks it would be 30% and if it doesn't and just gets rid of the maps then it would be 6% to drop said connected map. So if it was that 6% this would be 555% above avg and if it is the 30% then it would only be 11.1% above the avg. Or in terms of stastics based on the 30% it would have a p value of .6903 to be that 30% based on this data set vs a p value of 2.91E-10 assuming the 6%.\r  \n\r  \nTLDR pretty much guaranteed it forces a connected map"

It's the same logic how Tornado Shot has Low Budget versions that works ok, yet wouldn't really be as good as actual strong Low Budget Builds such as League Starters. But TS can scale up to Mirror Tier budget and become much better than a dedicated League Starter. In this case for DD, 40Div's would be what's considered the low budget required to get it to work smoothly.\n\nAnd yes, you could consider your HH/MB builds low budget in the context of a HH/MB build because you're at the low end spectrum of the build's potential. If your 10Div + HH/MB ends up with like 10M DPS and moderate survivability when a high end version of your same build costs 1 Mirror and goes up to 200M and is neigh unkillable, you are considered to be on a lower budget.\n\nTake a real life example, say you are buying a house and the bare minimum you need is a 5 room building. At the high end of say 2Mil, you get lots of amenities, good location, a front and backyard and even a garage. But you can't afford that, so you look for one on a lower budget of 1Mil. Sure, it doesn't have most of the above, but it's just enough for your needs. It's still low budget in the context of 5 room buildings even though a high end 3 room building could have been 700k"

Your main goal in the first place was to get a 5 Room Building, as cheap as possible, which is 1Mil in this case. Or if someone says, I want you to build a bridge with as low of a budget as possible, do you go \"Bridge too expensive, can't build\". That would be saying not having enough Budget to even meet Low Budget. You'd instead try to minimize the cost to build a bridge and attempt it, and if the min cost is 10M, that's Low Budget in the context of building the required Bridge.\n\nthat's why in the CONTEXT of buying a House (Build), a 3 room Building (League Starter) would be considered Low budget compared to buying a 5 room Building (High Potential Endgame Build). You are talking about the Context of Builds, when the poster is talking about the Context of JUST High Potential DD\n\nIn the Context of buying a 5 Room Building (High End DD), spending 1Mil (40Div's) is considered Low Budget when a high end 5 Room Building is 4Mil (1 Mirror). You WANT a 5 Room Building, not 3 Room, not 4 Room, not even a Mansion. So low Budget would be the cheaper spectrum of a 5 Room Building.\n\nAre you going to say, I want to eat Beef (Play High Potential DD), but I'm poor, so I'll buy Low Budget Beef. And then you buy Fish (Play Poison Seismic) just cause it happens to be cheaper than Beef? No, you'd buy Ground Beef (40 Div's)  instead of A1 Grade Wagyu (1 Mirror) because your goal is to eat Beef. Both are Beef but, one is obviously still cheaper even if Beef is much more expensive than Fish. In the context of Food, then Fish could be considered Low Budget compared to Beef"

One of which was a find the exit room, so I ran it with 0 flasks, so it doesn't really count. \n\nEven if we assume you could switch to 2 flasks needed, and only have to activate each of them once; you're still taking 20 resolve per room, which is as much as Spiked Exit if you have more than your starting resolve remaining."

It introduces no counterplay, no thoughtful decision-making; just \"Man, sure hope your build isn't based on Chaos damage. Would suck to be that guy.\" Expedition is different from Sanctum because you can ALWAYS read the remnant modifiers and choose not to detonate some.   \n\n\nFor bonus points, there's only 3 afflictions in the game that cause you to lose resolve outside of taking damage like normal; Spiked Exit, Death Toll, and Liquid Cowardice. Liquid Cowardice is worse than Spiked Exit if you use more than 1 flask a room and have at least 200 resolve, which is pretty much true of every single build I've ever seen, though many can limit flask use to mitigate it.  \nDeath Toll deals 250 resolve damage, which seems like a lot, but that's only 25 flask uses.   \nIf we assume you're a Pathfinder with +3 charges per 3 seconds, the average flask uses 30 charges, and you have +66% charges gained (all easy to do as Pathfinder), you would automatically trigger 4 magic flasks that many times in just under 2 minutes, completely ignoring charges gained on kill or crit.

I think its fine for crafting to have aspects that aren't immediately obvious but when you combine how hard it is to find good rares on the ground with how annoying inventory management is, it basically means you're forced into this frankenstein combination of gear to allow you to hit res while having decent life and damage to get into maps. I wish the gearing process from leveling into like red map farming was just a bit smoother. I'm not struggling with it in the sense that I can't do it, I just find it really boring and unfun to do\n\n>For me, knowing how POE can be an easy game with minimised hurdles takes you 5+ leagues to learn\n\nI've played a lot of PoE and I know a lot of people are assuming I'm just shit lol. its a fair assumption I guess, but I really know how to play the game and a lot of the base mechanics. I know what builds are meta and how to make OP leveling characters and all of that. my issue is that if you don't follow the meta the balance of the game is in a way that you really see how broken it is. if you play a meta build its a breeze and you can cruise into red maps. if you don't you realize much of the progression and systems rest on you being able to chase the meta to enjoy them. if you don't have a very strong build the game can be pretty miserable a lot of the time even if you do know the mechanics. taking ages to down a boss with perfect dodging because your build lacks damage (because the skill has been neglected for whatever reason) doesn't feel good at all\n\nI just wish the game was more balanced and less of a fuckfest of RNG. I think you can still have elite players dominating while reigning it in a bit. it's basically impossible for this game to turn into d3 so I wish people would stop bringing it up as a form of fearmongering. its just disingenuous at this point to keep using it as an example when the games aren't close and frankly will never be even similar in terms of depth or mechanics"

You can't get awakened burning dmg as a mod on elder helm so the pseudo 6L gimps your scaling. Whereas once you get awakened ele focus and inc aoe your RF one shots mobs anyways.

And to be fair at a certain point such issues sour the gaming experience and (I'd presume) alot of us just move on to something else that isn't having a hissy fit, not bothering enough to help getting it resolved.\n\nHowever I do idle quite a bit in-game (hoping for trades) and run traces whenever I load into a misbehaving instance. Over the last week I've run maybe half a dozen when there have been issues and just one of these revealed issues at previous hops that propagated to the data center, the others have all been clear of non-data center culprits.\n\nI might as well start saving them if I do any more."

For one reason or another, we ended up talking more and next thing I knew we were in this whirlwind relationship.  It was mostly long distance, but we were making it work with regular visits, face time, etc.  It was amazing and then it wasn't.\n\nIt started small, with things like while playing a game online together with her suddenly becoming someone else and berating me for making a mistake.  Then guilt tripping if I went to hang out with a friend instead of face timing 24/7.  Then came the gaslighting and blackmail.\n\nI kept telling myself that I could handle it and that it was just her BPD, and deep down she did love me because when she was fine, it was incredible and that was the real her.  So I would endure the abuse, the verbal beratements, the stories that made no sense and felt like they were told to make me feel bad, the lies.  I convinced myself that even though half the time I found myself curled up in bed crying because of it that I could handle it for her.\n\nThe last straw for me was when we had plans to visit and they got cancelled because she couldn't get the time off from work.  I said I was fine with it and I would do things around her apartment while she worked, but she refused and said it wasn't fair.  And when that week came that we were supposed to be together, all communication stopped.  Found out she was taking a trip to see a friend elsewhere but for some reason didn't want me to know.\n\nShe called about 4 years ago (after 2 years of not hearing from her) to see how I was doing \"without her\" and hoped that I had someone who could comfort me through the loss."

He would partner up with a rogue doctor  \nrunning an illegal vivisection clinic where subjects were surgically  \nexperimented upon for increasing the pair\u2019s medical knowledge. Eventually  \nFloridius was arrested and served time in a Waterdeep prison for his crimes and  \nhis partner and instructor disappeared without a trace. After years of  \nimprisonment, he was released and made for the fortress of Candlekeep where he  \nwould begin his studies anew. In exchange for his stay there he taught a class  \non biology and anatomy often performing vivisections on creatures for  \ndemonstrations... This was not a popular class for many reasons.  \nAfter months in Candlekeep, Floridius  \nmet a party of adventurers who were seeking a method to transition to the Nine  \nHells to track down a rogue angel who became an archduke of hell. Floridius saw  \nthis as an opportunity to study the immortal flesh of devils to further his  \nstudies, and so he requested to tag along, offering his medical expertise to  \nthe group as well as his skills with small blades to act as an excellent rogue.  \nThe Hells ended up teaching the  \nmad doctor quite a lot on immortality, but he was also falling further into the  \ndepths of corruption as he had met with and exchanged knowledge for knowledge  \nwith a bound and then freed flesh-shaping demon. The demon taught Floridius the  \nart of fleshcraft and how to graft monster components onto himself and others.  \nAfter the party left the Hells, Floridius  \nhad multiple journals of notes on the study of immortality via fleshcraft,  \nsurgical replacement of organs, and other less than savory means. But he is no  \ngod, and thus his control of the immortal soul and its binding to mortal flesh  \nis limited. So, his next goal was clear: transcend the limitations of his  \nmortal coil, perform the ultimate necromantic rituals to bind his soul to an  \nobject, and transplant his organs to a fleshcrafted golem. With this he would  \nbecome a lich like no other; an immortal flesh golem with the knowledge to  \ngrant this gift unto others. However, the pursuit of such ability has forever  \nchanged the mad doctor and his studies and research have no place in  \ncivilization.  \nWhat do you think? :)"

In other words, a farmer could mainly re-\r\nvere Chauntea, but also pray to appease Talos to \r\nkeep crop-damaging storms away, Malar to keep \r\nbeasts from attacking him or his folk in the fields \r\nand to send vermin elsewhere, Talona to keep dis-\r\nease and blight at bay, and so on.\n\r\n Any mortal of any race can worship any deity. \r\nOf course, a would-be worshiper\u2019s upbringing \r\nand moral or ethical stance make some match-\r\nups of faith and individual highly unlikely. The \r\nmost unusual ones are usually the result of an \r\nindividual searching for the right calling, or as-\r\ncribing the outcome of an important life event to \r\nthe influence or direct action of a particular deity. \r\nThat phenomenon extends to divine casters, too, \r\nthough some priesthoods don\u2019t welcome unusual \r\nraces, such as drow or illithids, as clergy.\n\r\n The average Faer\u00fbnian lives long enough to \r\nworship (or serve through one\u2019s actions) one deity \r\nabove all others\u2014though in many cases, which \r\ndeity a given person has served most might not be \r\nclear to a dying mortal or anyone else.\n\n[...]\n\nA few deities, Cyric being one, are insane \r\nenough not to recognize and accept the polytheis-\r\ntic \u201cappease this deity and that, as life situations \r\nand strivings demand\u201d model. These mad few \r\ndemand that their faithful worship them and only \r\nthem. Almost all other deities accept and engage \r\nin competition for worshipers, though most mor-\r\ntals can\u2019t begin to perceive and understand the \r\nintricate, long games of divine machinations, and \r\nmight well misinterpret what little they see. For \r\nalmost all mortals, religion is a matter of embrac-\r\ning primary worship of one deity above\u2014even if \r\nonly slightly above\u2014all others.\n\n[...]\n\nMost people in the Realms embrace a patron (pri-\r\nmary) deity, and carry a token, a holy symbol, or \r\na remembrance of that primary god. Adventurers \r\nusually pray briefly to this deity in the morning, \r\nwhen they aren\u2019t under attack or in some emer-\r\ngency, as well as at moments of crisis, such as \r\nhealing a wounded friend or trying to keep a sick \r\nor poisoned person alive. They offer lengthier \r\nprivate prayers following evening meals or upon \r\nretiring to slumber. Such prayers are usually re-\r\nquests for protection and direction, and deities \r\nor their servitors often reply with guidance in \r\nthe form of dream visions, or more rarely in sud-\r\nden mental visions received while awake. Each of \r\nthese visions is usually a snapshot seen only by \r\nthe worshiper, and it usually comes tinged with a \r\nfeeling of favor or disapproval.\r\n Rarely, a divine response to a worshiper comes \r\nas a sign visible to everyone present. \""

I'd say you've got an inquisitors situation.\n\nSince you've got a runaway mage's guild, there won't be any subtlety from the courts.

Don't stress on the rules just yet either of they've never played before. Also don't make it exotic like letting someone make a minotaur warrior or something just stick to the races, and classes in the core book.\n\nIf you don't have the books I suggest White Box Medieval Fantasy which you can download for free off driverhrurpg or can purchase cheaply off Amazon for about $4 each. The game itself is very simple to understand, and read.  Maybe even let the parents see the books for themselves so they can see its nothing too risque."

And then they casually retcon the fan-favorite steel dragon out of existence... and there isn't even a section about dragon physiology *at all*..."
    },
    {
      "author": "LostN3ko",
      "body": "Ok. I have my Draconomicon for the physiology stuff so I wasn't hoping to get that out of the book. IIRC that section did say that this was just one of the many different myths about dragons. But I just want to say that in its defense it was the first argument that justified Tiamat to me. Everything else just portrays her as just capital E Evil. That she is basically Satan with scale. But in this version she is more like a mother bear, she created this place working along with Bahamut something that by most interpretations should be impossible due to them being polar opposites. And that her creation was invaded and she fought to defend it. That she had a right to hate all these races and want them dead, that she lost due to the masses of other races and their gods. Bahamut saw the writing on the wall and decided sharing their creation was better than seeing it burn and turned his back on her. That she is the last abandoned warrior not willing to give up what is rightfully hers to the invaders. Honestly it gave me a new perspective and origin myth that put her in a light other than \"She is the evil twin. All the evil got stuck in her and that's why she is Evil.\" But she is just the victim of invaders who are desecrating her creation, even her oldest ally has abandoned her and after all the injustices she has suffered she will not CAN NOT let it go, she wants to save it from them but after so long and everything getting worse and worse for her even if she has to burn it all down she would rather that than to see it desecrated by invaders.\n\nIs the story true? Does it mesh with other canon? It's certainly the story that the cult of the dragon preaches in my world now and makes them better enemies than the classic mustache twirling villain. I take every new book in D&D as having an unreliable author. Somethings they say are true some are not and it all depends on which world your playing in."

      "body": "See, the view on Tiamat that you describe is actually not at all so far out of line\u2014but not because of anything in Fizban's. \n\nI do not believe anything is written of it anywhere, but if you take the view that Io is the one true creator, and that the material plane is his gift to dragonkind, meant first and foremost for them, and that after Io's death at the hands of the primordials, dragons no longer had a true caretaker deity precisely because of Tiamat and Bahamut's complete inability to agree on anything, the case is that in the meantime all these other gods have shown up and added their own creations to the prime material, and those creations are then getting uppity\u2014not because of any divine war, which never happened, but simply because they are mortals who are inconvenienced by dragonkind, and start to take the land and treasures that belong to the dragons...\n\nIo's view on the other gods and their creations was permissive and neutral-cooperative, taking the side of both dragons and other mortals in equal measure, albeit with the ultimate concern being to further dragon interests in the long run. You then might say that Bahamut and Tiamat inherited those traits, but split and fanatically extremist.\n\nWith that context in mind, Tiamat's view is to be *furious* that these mortal pretenders dare to harm dragon interests, and more importantly, that the Prime Material Plane and everything upon it belongs to her by right of inheritance\u2014and although she is still evil and filled with hate, she is not wrong. She then views Bahamut as a weak-willed pushover all too eager to give away what he should have rightfully inherited from Io. Thus, Tiamat may be greedy and covetousness... but she kind of has a divine right to be so, because she is the closest thing to a true heir that the prime material has. Which only makes it extra bitter to be stuck on Avernus."

      "author": "LostN3ko",
      "body": "That is very true both stories lead to the same place we are today and Tiamat having a right to feel possessive. The big difference being that Tiamat and Bahamut working together to create the PMP kinda has a feel of two equals working hand in hand with grand visions of what it will be. Kinda like a couple preparing their first house and waiting for a baby. But instead of that a bunch of rats chewed their way into the walls and together they tried to put a stop to it. Bahamut using no kill traps and Tiamat using poison. Then Bahamut says this isn't working out lets just live along side them, they deserve to live too and we can just let them raid the pantry every now and then for what they need. Tiamat is like WTF dude THERE ARE RATS.... IN OUR HOUSE! THEY GOTTA GO! But now Bahamut is trying to make a smooth transition and Tiamat is left as the only sane person in the house, all her plans are ruined, the one other real \"person\" in her life has gone mad and sided with the rats and its up to her to fix everything by herself. Then they go full Rattatouille tie her up and throw her in the closet taking ownership of Bahamut as one of their own. The ultimate betrayal.\n\nThe other version has her just starting off as being a nepo baby resting bitchface who has every right to the inheritance but you don't really want to root for her at all because she just comes off as entitled and greedy and unwilling to work with the sensible Bahamut. While this isn't far from the truth its kinda like the difference between watching a disney OG movie and watching the villain origin story where they try to frame Cruella or Maleficent in a better light by showing that they didn't start off unreasonable and cruel, they had dreams of a happy life where only good things would happen to them and those around them only to wind up bitter and resentful of the shit hand they were dealt. I can't help but feel like having her start off as cooperative and hopeful and then fall makes her more relatable as a villain than just having her just be an avatar of all the bad parts of Io like a moral trash bin just so Bahamut can be pure. It's a bit of sympathy for the devil.\n\nEither way I like both stories and am just happy to have origins for dragons and have dragons be rightfully the most bad ass things in it. I mean it also sits alongside all the other stories like the abeloths enslaving mortals then the mortals create gods to save them. Their story doesn't even give any credit to dragons and their famous wars with the giants."

It has a lot of DM judgement though, so if it\u2019s been useful for you, I\u2019d keep at it. Intelligence saves are one of the best and it requires the enemy to make an investigation check which is also great.

Thus she agreed to carry a magical baby to term for him. After having him she left him in the woods on a stump (the agreed upon location) but the Hillsteppers found the baby first and the demon has been searching ever since. finally finding him on his 13th birthday awaking his powers causing the flames.\n\nThoughts?"

I think it'd work out nicely if the Hillsteppers were off-island when they found Davrin and that helps explain what took the demon so long to track his offspring down.\n\nThe only race that would make logical sense is half-elf, but I don't think that captures the fun of your idea the way you're wanting. The problem I have (and you can just ignore my problem) is that Davrin would have to be absolutely daft to make it to 20+ without realizing he is a human instead of a gnome/dwarf/hafling/whatever. Conceptually it may sound fun, but in practice what does that achieve? It sounds like it would be a funny gag at first but then gets stale as Davrin continues to claim he is a gnome. If you're actually playing Davrin in a campaign with a DM and other PCs he would have left the island and be among others who can observe and outright tell him \"dude, you're not a gnome.\"\n\nThe way to circumvent this is through a potent charm or curse that CONVINCES Davrin he is a gnome regardless of what people say. He literally sees himself as gnome. Or like a Hat of Disguise but permanently implanted as a magical tattoo or something and he doesn't even realize it. Maybe the Hillsteppers made a deal with the Fey: \"We always wanted a baby and now we have one, but it's a human and we really want him to grow up as a gnome\" and the Fey magically influence Davrin as a baby to make him perceive himself as a gnome. \n\nIf you have a DM you can work out details with them, or they may not care at all and just agree he thinks he's a gnome.

Some of my players are less experienced, so I'd like to save the staples of WOTC campaigns like Curse of Strahd or Tomb of Annihilation for later when they are more experienced and know the game better. I've heard that Strixhaven is bare-bones, and there aren't a lot of maps for it and stuff, and (from my experience) theatre of the mind playing doesn't work very well online, so that wouldn't really work.  \n**- TLDR for this paragraph in particular:** I have various reasons (apart from the constraints of online play) to not play those, listed in the original post, and expanded within this post.\n\nTo address your second point about non-WOTC campaigns, I hadn't really considered non-official campaigns, so I will look at the ones you've listed, and most-likely others.\n\nYour response is appreciated."

They had some really great ideas and then just figured that dungeon Masters would fill in the rest for them, it honestly feels like a product that either had a bunch of pages from its print run cut away and had to adapt, or a project that was released several months before the design team was ready for it to be.\nTheater of the mind works fine online, it's no different than doing it in person, it really isn't. The trick online, just like the trick in real life, is to try and keep the players focused. If it helps, just think about it this way, you're doing theater of the mind for basically everything other than combat anyway, combats not actually different in that regard"

While wondering the cave for refuge, the ground beneath him gave way, sending him tumbling deeper into the casam. Here he stayed for countless days. Surrounded by the pitch black warmth of the abyss. When the cold hand of Death from starvation and dehydration, a calming voice echoed into his mind. Alabast's first thought was finally his prayers had been answered, the Raven Queen has heard him and has come to offer him salvation. \n   However, soon after reviewing the gifts of this being claiming to be the Raven Queen, Alabast began to notice slight changes in his physical appearance.

If it can do a lot of stuff, chances are the singular things it does will be fairly minor in strength, like the robe of many uses.

I'll edit after rechecking on what they are since I'm on mobile.\n\nEdit: First thing that is notable is having three different, all equally rare damage types. That's strong in numerous ways: Almost nothing will have resistance against you, with those three damage types accessible. It also means you're dealing more damage types, and thus being able to hit a monsters vulnerability easier on varying encounters. \n\nNext thing to note is that these are all rider effects, meaning you're still doing your normal attack **along with** these additional effects. That's incredibly strong, seeing as you can still stack these with a sharpshooter attack, any concentration damage spells, stuff like that. I don't mind the 1 charge abilities all that much. They're still really strong, seeing as this is just in an item. But thats fine. But all of the three charge uses are just supercharged spells, on top of an attack. That's so incredibly strong. Its basically taking two actions for one, given youre playing a class that can even cast those spells. I'd just drop these entirely, seeing as the weapon is strong enough as is without these.

I could stick with that rule, or make it take a full action to swap damage types.\n\n\\- I definitely picked optimized damage types, but given the above point, that bothers me less. My DM certainly isn't above adding some resistances to our enemies to keep things balanced.\n\nRegarding the 2nd tier effects:\n\n\\- I could certainly restrict the effects to \"until the end of the target's next turn,\" and/or drop the weapon damage and simply apply the debuff. Would one or both of these help skew balance back to equilibrium?"

Probably fine using a weapon attack as well, seeing that there's an abundant amount of creatures where the damage type won't even matter. \n\nHonestly I'd avoid a save or suck spell for the 2nd tier effect being the only thing, only because it'd it'll probably feel pretty bad to use however many charges only for it to flop. If it's 'until the start of your next turn', it'll guarantee one round of effectiveness. For 2 charges that's pretty good along with a minor amount of a damage rider/alternate effect, so you never truly whiff. \n\nWhatever you end up going for though, try to make the comparative power between 1st tier and 2nd tier relative to each other. Otherwise it might end up being that for three charges, it's way stronger to use the 1st tier ability 3 times than it would be the 2nd tier one once. Also vice versa, tier 2 ability might be much stronger bang for your buck than tier 1. Otherwise cool abilities have a chance to be less interesting because of difference in power per charge.

Drawing a bow and not being able to shoot it sounds like a massive source of frustration. For any other object, pulling it out still requires an interact, I think. It also would make sense to have this kind of limitation on spellcasting, minor though as it may be."

That song was the one he heard during the massacre of his home, when a red-haired dwarf ringleader calmly played it while their gnoll mercenary hirelings killed everyone around him."

He is a Face, a hero, and a massive one at that.\r  \n\r  \nAfter his escape from the Nakigahara clan,  he lives peacefully in a small village with his adopted son. All of the villagers talk about how kind and sweet he is, how apologetic he can be, BUT,He just folded a DEMON into an INFERNAL PRETZEL. The bone cracking ECHOED! His fists broke wind as they landed on the Yokai's body, making impact like GUNSHOTS.\r  \n\r  \nYou won't know! Is he gonna let out a breath of fire! Is he gonna send out a barrage of forearm slams!? Is he gonna grab the nearest Oni and spike him into the ground at Mach Speed!? You have to keep your eyes on him! One thing for sure, you don\u2019t want to enrage him!"

      "body": "oh this is a lot\n\nI dumped mental stats because below-average is pretty accurate to Travis. Most saves I seem to have to worry about are wisdom, which I get proficiency in from Samurai.\n\nThe AC being low is because I'm going to multiclass into Barb for Unarmored / Rage later on (probably lvl 9), and 14 isn't abysmal. The DM seems to be going easy on the party anyways (keep in mind we are in high school, and just for an example of a character, we have a gigachad 8 con/dex wizard is in the party)\n\nDex saves are actually fairly common from what I've been able to tell, especially considering I'm front lining.\n\nAbout why I'm practically copying the character - It's a pretty niche series that I've made sure to check nobody knows at the school, and I know people probably won't play the game because I tell them to. If they won't ever play NMH, I can at least try to be Travis to make people laugh saying bad, corny one liners. I know there is a lot more I could be doing with an original character - but I read this character sheet after I was finished with it and I just started laughing. I can see why it makes you and possibly others disappointed, but this is something I find funny and I just wanna do it.\n\nP.S, from experience, I can definitely not be the best at role playing (especially with people I have little clue how they act, for the session I spectated they were stuck in a battle for the 2 hour session, which that battle isn't even over!), and just basing the character off something I adore and I'm familiar with is comfortable for me.\n\nEDIT after forgetting to bring it up: It's not a meme character, I purposefully didn't copy literally exactly Travis's character because I'm going to bring up different themes and ideas from the character (basically wanting to explore some concepts of the value of a life, if revenge is ever worth it, some general moral compass questions etc.) considering the change in setting allowing for it.\n\nI do appreciate this response, though. It made me think about the character entirely."

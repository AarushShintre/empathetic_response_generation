Those pre schools you sent were part of a group of private high schools so are essentially a prep school and are expensive.  It\u2019ll only be the very well off using those.

It is about recognising the harm that is being done by our society, and trying to make a change, avoid being part of it - as far as we can. In future, as more and more people go vegan, there will be more and more alternatives developed because research will be put into new technology. Right now we are a minority, so why would giant corporations be saying \"Hmm, what can we use in car tyres apart from this small amount of animal ingredients?\" But as the world changes, those things will follow, and animal use will continue to decline, so it will be easier to avoid animal use in other areas of life."

We have evidence of written copies of several of the minor prophets going back to about the seventh to eighth centuries BC, but I think it would be a mistake to suggest that the Hebrew scriptures didn't exist before then. Not only have we probably lost plenty of the documentary evidence, we are also dealing with what was primarily an oral culture for most of its existence. People would have spoken the stories that went on to be codified into the Hebrew Bible for centuries before ink was ever set upon vellum. Despite the fact that we wouldn't think of that as 'documentation' because we're a text-based society, there is a fair anthropological argument that if stories such as that of Abraham, which was only put down in writing hundreds of years after he lived, were known widely among the people of Israel and Judah and were shared from generation to generation, that's essentially oral codification."

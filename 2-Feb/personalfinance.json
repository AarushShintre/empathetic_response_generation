Maybe also digging through property tax records to get an idea of how those stack up to market valuations, and potentially estimating the market costs of other home that don't go up for sale.\n\nI guess the good news is that I kind of get a boner for this sort of exhaustive research, so this is right up my alley..."

Having access to a big pile of money now can end up being more beneficial to your life, even with that higher cost.  Borrowing for things like an education (ideally improves your future income potential) or a house (since everyone needs someplace to live) aren't too bad.  \n\nPlan for the future.

I do like your suggestion though, since we'd be contributing to both accounts for 18 years so they'd both have time in the market.

For example, some banks offer more favorable benefits if you keep certain amount of money with them. Others offer sign up bonuses. Opening new cards increases the total amount of credit available to you and eventually increases your credit score through lower total utilization. If you have an emergency, you may not need to disturb your investments etc. \n\nIf you\u2019re responsible with your finances, unsecured no interest (or low interest) loan is always worth it!"

That is their business. \n\nthe lender attached to a dealer is called a 'captive lender' and they differ from a traditional lender because they literally are a business unit within the dealership.  \n\nWhat that means in practice is that a captive lender can OK deals that are 'bad deals' from a cost of capital angle (like loaning at 0.9%) because the net deal is positive for the dealership (because they make money on the car sale, make quota, yadda yadda) \n\nor said otherwise, the dealership likely isn't actually doing these loans at 0.9%, they are using the 0.9% as a loss leader to move cars... somewhere along the way they are buying that money at \\~3% (or otherwise some rate above 0.9%) but are placing/making up that cost elsewhere on the deal that they put in front of you (the cost of the car, any extras they sell you, those are the money makers) \n\nI hope that makes sense.  its a bit of a visual trick on the buyer, but its not a scam or anything, its very common."

A 0.15% difference in interest on $100,000 deposit is $150 PER YEAR. $15 for a $10,000 deposit. Hardly worth your time in the grand scheme of investing. Park your cash in an account you have easy access to and only move it if you do the math and it makes sense.\n\nso basically like Ally is 3.40% now, wealthFront is 3.75% anything in the 4+% probably unstable and weird with getting money in/out.\n\nIf say I deposit $50K (probably close to what I would) -\n\nit's $1700 a year for ally's rate now,\n\n$1875 a year for wealthFront...\n\nand with Ally being known for being super easy, customer friendly etc. and quick transfer in/out without gimmicks etc it might be way to go.\n\nInstead of wasting time hunting rates.

Lastly, lets say I have $1000 cash I can afford to put in a taxable brokerage with the lower AGI, and after doing all this my take-home is $25k (lower AGI).  \n\nIf I lower my Traditional by $1000, my taxes go up $200 which means net income goes up by $800 (because $1k less is going into my 401k). This gives me $1800 cash (the $1000 cash I had before + the $800 after-tax from lowering my traditional).  \n\nSo the comparison is:  \n\n1) $1000 cash into a brokerage with $25k net pay afterwards.  \n-vs-  \n2) $1000 into Roth with $25.8k net pay afterwards (the $800 remaining after lowering my Traditional).  \n\nI feel like I'm missing something, maybe it's just too late but it seems to favor swapping out Traditional for Roth in the situation where a taxable brokerage is generally recommended."

In that situation, you gain more by switching some Traditional to Roth instead of keeping it all in Traditional and using a Taxable account for the excess. It only applies if you're maxing your 401k.  \n\nAdditionally, for myself personally, I'll most likely have a decent pension (which adds taxable dollars in the lower brackets), so I'll have less space to convert Traditional to Roth later than others might."

      "body": "Proper answer is key because you usually have 20 days to respond.\n\nAfter that if *proper* answer wasn't filed with court and copy sent to the other attorney they basically go back to court and judge gives them a paper that lets them garnish your wages and bank account (if state law permits).\n\nBasically court is a big bureaucracy.\n\nChase goes to court and sues you. You can see in the lawsuit there are a bunch of numbered points such as 1. your name is bob 2. you live in collin county texas 3. you opened account with chase bank 4. your balance outstanding was 4,322.32 on 2/15/2022, etc\n\nBasically the way that court works is anything they say is true unless you file something to oppose it and then they have to provide proof such as a full accounting of charges, interest, and payments to add up to that amount.\n\nTherefore a proper answer is going to look like 1. agree my name is bob smith 2. agree I live in Collin County Texas and everything else about the account, the balance, the interest rate, etc is going to be \" deny\" \n\nStart the negotiation with \"I have $1000 in the bank, need $500 for rent on the 1st... are you willing to settle this for $500 today\" and go from there."

      "body": "Yes. You would never file an answer accepting everything.\n\nIf you accept everything it's actually worse than ignoring. If you accept everything they just go back to the judge and because you accepted everything there is no legal issue at hand and they win automatically. They will get summary judgement.\n\nThis is worse than ignoring it because in many states you can often go back to court say 2 months later and plead \"excusable neglect\"  to get the default judgement overturned.\n\nIf you admit to everything you have much less window to do anything because you got the notice, went to court, and said everything they claim you owe is 100% correct with no dispute.\n\nYou're being sued by original creditor and they have all the records. All this does is buy you some time. In fact I should have mentioned you should not be in a rush to file answer. Know your deadline and file answer say 5 days before it's due. Don't file answer 15 days early!\n\nWhat I recommend you do is go in creditboards.com and register an account and then look for the Help! I've been served section. It will not show up unless you are registered."

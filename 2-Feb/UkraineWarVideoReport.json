They just split up in different ways and for different reasons. European nation-building vs culturally defined nations."

Were you not given theoretical lessons as well as pure drilling? You shoot center mass and if they drop, you've done your job. Your job as an Infantryman isn't to think of tactics or strategies, but it isn't to **kill** either. It's to work as a part of your squad and company, advancing on enemies and **disabling** them. Destroying their ability to fight.\n\nIf one could make the perfect marksman, then a hit to the armpit/shoulder of the side they shoot on would be ideal, as it prevents them from continuing to fight, leaves them alive but screaming for help, and their partner/squad mates will have to discontinue their fighting to staunch the bleeding. But of course a shot like that isn't feasible, so double shot to center mass. Hits are usually fatal, but it might take hours and definitely binds enemy resources and will to fight. \n\nShow me a single text saying the goal in war is to kill the enemy, please. That says explicitly to \"**kill**\". \n\n>You could argue that those Russians were captured and not escaping or continuing hostile acts but it would be a weak argument.\n\n\"It would be a weak argument\"\n\nYou've given **no** argument except \"kill everything, that's your mission, they couldn't afford to give those russians they were speaking and gesturing to a chance to surrender\"\n\nYou don't have **any** basis for why a person would be able to do that in a fight. But after the fight, while securing the area, they would. In which case they also would have had the chance to offer surrender, and if the russians were not continuing hostile actions nor escaping, shooting them would possibly be a warcrime. We don't know the situation, but you've given no rationale to your **opinion** and I've given actual sourced facts on what is and isn't allowed.\n\nSo the weak argument is definitely **yours.**"

Those two countries have history. Germany is the biggest economy in EU, with the biggest power in EU parliament and the biggest ties to Russia and Russian gas. Looking at their politics towards Russia, trying to lower EU payments for weapons send to Ukraine also is a way to lower amounts of weapons other EU members will want to send. Since the whole idea of EU funds was to encourage this procedure. \n\nSince EU is a union of states that basically argue and discuss every decision among members, and many of them cannot be made due to disagreements I am not shocked this is also put under discussion as such. \n\nWe had arguments about funds after covid or funds for farmers and on and on, basically every country tries to get as much as they can. \n\n The 2nd article just says Poland doesn't want to agree on return rate below 50%, so it's not more than they pay for new tanks, it's not even the same they will pay, its half of what older tanks are wort etc. Also, it just says they are the ones who disagree with the EU rates and that's just politics, it's like with your job contract, you argue to get the best deal you can, they would be stupid to agree on the first offer especially that EU was for the long time neglecting the matter of sending heavy weapons to Ukraine and cutting ties with Russia. \n\nIt is also obvious that countries who send less equipment will agree to lower return rates since it is still a small amount of money in general, but when it comes to billions. Even 1% is a lot. If EU agrees to help Ukraine, it is reasonable that it does it together, lower rates are making less rich country like Poland have way bigger weight on it's shoulders. I don't see the reason why EU wouldn't be able to offer even bigger return rate, after all every weapon send to Ukraine, fights enemy we won't need to fight later."

This is just hypocrisy since the whole thing is progressing. USA is accepting new plans of aid to Ukraine so can EU, you expect those who help to just take what EU parliament gives them, and remain silent, which is basically acknowledging EU judge that was wrong about Russia the whole time. \n\nWhen it comes to housing for refugees: \n\nMost of Ukrainians that came to Poland already have jobs and lives on their own, there is mamy plans for them to help with renting flats or even getting them. Since there are not prognosis of such a rapid exodus of new refugees and basically the money from EU covers barely 1/6 of the costs of refugees, this is no shock they want to limit the expenses. You have to have money to spend money, if you can't afford the whole thing, 1/4 is more than nothing. We may belive it should stay 100% yes but if you, some random from Internet have problem with who gets money, so are politicians in the country that spends it. \n\nYou seem like there is something you have against Poland but your arguments are basically none existing. If you thought there is a single government in the World that is selfless, I have bad info for you. \n\nAnother thing is the fact that noone in the Government is helping Ukraine because they love Ukrainians. They all have a business in it, the difference is, some want Russia to fail and some ( guess who ) wants Russian gas back, to push their economy.\n\nEU is based on combining funds from its members and distributing it according to need not evenly, it's a very organisation Germany created and is the country with biggest influence in it. It goes for years that less developed countries pay less and get more to make them grow, and it's the politics that gave Poland a massive push since 2003. Now because you don't like Poland, you make the way of how EU works looks like something wrong and scandalous. Weak foreign politics of Germany partially led us all to this situation. As the country that gained the most on good politics with Russia, country that opposed sending major military help to Ukraine for so long, country that let their armed forces get in such a bad shape it doesn't even know how many tanks it has. If not other countries, Ukraine would fall, if German point of view on Russia was claimed as good one, Ukraine would fall. So really I get that you are jelous because thanks to Scholz Germany has bad PR but being angry because others help more and want to use tools offered for them to maximum seems just wrong. After all it's not Poland that needed to be pushed by others to do something. \n\n\nAnd oh most of all. Politics are politics.

If you would read it, you would understand that being a net contributor doesn't matter as an argument since the whole thing with EU was made that way by the very countries that are net contributors, it's not like somebody made them do it you freaking genius. EU is created to work this way, bigger economies provide more wealth to let the whole EU in some future grow together, that's why other want to join, that's why so many did and if it is too hard for you to understand and you thing Germany is a victim here, this whole discussion makes no sense. Countries who pay more also have more from it, like places in parliament or so. This is not one surface game man. Maybe it's too complex for your agenda to calculate \ud83e\udd37\n\nMaybe if you would read with understanding you would know I already did say Poland is where it is only because of not being the net contributor but those who get stuff from EU. No surprises here, but for you apparently many. \n\nNext thing. Yes if you search the amount of aid by euros you will find that between September 2022 and November 2022 Germany did overtake Poland in net worth of aid to Ukraine however. We are still waiting for February summary and when it comes to % of GDP Germany is way lower in it with 0,14 %GDP and Poland with 0,5% GDP. The question is if you can expect others to pay bigger percentage of their GDP just because you are rich and there is more of you. Because when split into per capita, it costs one German citizien less money than one Polish citizien while German one still earns more.\n\nhttps://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/y\n\nAnother thing, those diagrams are based only on official data of aid. Nowadays we know Poland send fighter jets to Ukrain early in war, that was classified. Same with other weapons we still don't know but informations about them not being in the storage is starting to leak to public, do you think they don't need to provide proof they send something before getting refunds? Really? \n\n\nNow Page 41 \n\nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9477/\n\n It is claimed that Poland gave around 1,7 bil $ of aid to Ukraine. Your article says Poland is responsible for almost half of receipts from all amount of 3,3 bil. Half of 3,3 is 1,65 so almost half can be 1,6 can be 1,5, we don't know exactly but I assume it would be 1,7 bil $ transfered to Euros what is for today rate 1,56 bil of euros (shocking), which is exactly what they gave, which is exactly what are you suppose to request in the program and then you get % of this back. Your own argument proves that just the way it is written makes Poland look bad even tho they literally did what they were suppose to. Yes % of return drops with this because the money EU gives is not changing but military aid is bigger than they expected. You have to be an ignorant to not understand that. \n\nAs of this, I just see ignorance and reading without understanding on your side. \n\nHave a good night"

During the WW2, Ukrainian soldiers fought in  \n1) Red Army / Soviet Union  \n2) SS Forces (1st Galician, Roland, Nachtigall)  \n3) Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN)  \n\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the 2nd and 3rd parts were erased from our history. We learned only about the Soviet Heroes. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine started slowly to accept them as part of its history.   \nThe process is described only as \"glorifying of Ukrainian Neo-Nazis\" by Russia. This is not true, we learn good & ugly about them.  \n\n\nIt is extremely important to know and understand history in order to not repeat it. Russia missed this lesson.  \n\n\n>From this video, it looks like Azov has done a lot of work to clean up their image. I'm hoping that continues.\n\nAgain, from my point of view, Azov did absolutely nothing to 'clean up'. They really don't care about comments on Reddit or Youtube.  \nBut we had \"Hey, Americans think that the N+I symbol is a Nazi symbol, let's replace it. Fuck, we've already changed our logo 4 times.\". They adopted the trident symbol. No one openly uses or used Nazi symbols.\n\n  \n1) Ukrainian Nationalism existed for centuries. Ukrainians had dozens of revolts against Russia, Poland and other countries.   \n2) the Soviet Union contained 15 republics with different cultures and nations.  \n\\- slavic orthodox white (Belorus, Ukraine, Russia)  \n\\- muslim (Dagestan, Ichkeria, Chehnya, Crimean Tatars)  \n\\- central asians (Kazakstan, Tadjikistan, Uzbekistan, Tukmenistan, Kyrgystan)  \n\\- caucasus  \n\n\nWe had A LOT of internal issues, we had them after the Soviet Union, and ex-Soviet countries still have them.  \n\n\nAmericans often bring their own experience and label things as \"racism\" or \"white supremacy\" but these problems have absolutely different roots."

According to the city mayor, about 20 businesses have already transferred to Novovolynsk. Additionally, persons who moved to Novovolynsk due to the war opened at least three new caf\u00e9s in the city.\n\nThe blue design of Sleep Sugar coffee shop near Novovolynsk park reminds a coastal city. This is not a coincidence, as its owner was making coffee on the Black Sea coast in Odesa, where he worked in a restaurant business.\n\nVadym, 31, is originally from Novovolynsk but he has been studying and working in Odesa for the past twelve years. After returning to Novovolynsk following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, he decided it was time to \u201cmake coffee ourselves.\u201d Together with his Novovolynsk-native friend Vlad, they opened Sleep Sugar Coffee Point.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make an atmospheric place, not one where one buys coffee and immediately forgets about it,\u201d Vadym explains. \u201cHere in Novovolynsk, people have fallen in love with our coffee, and many displaced people from Kherson and Mykolayiv also visit us. When we talk to them, they all want to go home. Even though Novovolynsk is a pleasant place to live, people still long to return home.\u201d\nAnother caf\u00e9 was relocated from Irpin, a town near Kyiv that was devastated by Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion and occupation. A couple, Vitaliy and Valeriya, had run a family business in Irpin for a decade. The war forced the family with a 10-month-old baby to leave their home.\n\nAfter the first month in Novovolynsk, Vitaliy and Valeriya realized that the town was a good fit for opening a caf\u00e9. They kept the name of their caf\u00e9 in Irpin, and the Taddy Coffee signboard was sent directly from there to Novovolynsk. Having found a place near a grass plot, they arranged a summer site with a playground at the entrance. Taddy Coffee contributes 10% of its profits to the Armed Forces of Ukraine."

However, in the spring, they could not find one in Novovolynsk. So they decided to create such a place themselves.\n\n\u201cOver the past two years, the city [Novovolynsk] has changed greatly; it has become more beautiful and well-kept, and the locals are friendly. But my husband and I were missing delicious coffee. We are used to 100% Arabica, which couldn\u2019t find here. So we decided to simultaneously help the economy and start our own business, where the locals can enjoy delicious coffee.

Poland bought enough Abrams tanks alone to replace their ones they donated.\n\nAlso, here's what Oryx says about your cherished Ringtausch:\n\n>Although this seemed a promising scheme at first, the 'Ringtausch' programme has largely failed to live up to expectations as most countries expect to have their Soviet-era systems replaced by larger numbers of modern weapon systems than what Berlin is currently able (or willing) to offer.  \n>  \n>\\[snip\\]  \n>  \n>Poland was offered just 20 Leopard 2A4s (and curiously, 100 Leopard 1A5s) instead of the 44 MBTs to equip a full tank battalion it was expecting. \\[1\\]  \n>  \n>\\[snip\\]  \n>  \n>A deal to supply Czechia with fourteen Leopard 2A4s and one B\u00fcffel armoured recovery vehicle (ARV) was only sealed on August 29, 2022, some four months after the country first supplied Ukraine with an unknown number of T-72M1s. \\[4\\] \\[5\\] As these T-72s came from reserve stocks, the 'Ringtausch' programme is perhaps more accurately described as a rewards programme rather than a scheme aimed at directly replacing lost capabilities beforehand.   \n>  \n>\\[snip\\]  \n>  \n>In retrospect, the 'Ringtausch' concept was perhaps doomed from the start by its own inherent contradictions.   \n>  \n>https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/09/flawed-but-commendable-germanys.html\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Rather than outright replacing the 250 or more MBTs lost by Ukraine since February 24, the vast majority of the Polish-delivered T-72s are currently held back for use with newly-established mechanised brigades in future offensive actions.\"\n\nAs I observed to the other person, now check Oryx's source for that claim.

I have, and they all answer \"2014\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You could use that argument against both countries equally, actually against every country.\n\nNo, you cannot.  Only Germany was building Nord Stream 2, with Russia, while the later was waging war in Ukraine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Are you sure? when and how exactly? \n\nYes, I am completely sure.  If you are completely unaware of Germany's history in NATO, avoid this line of inquiry.\n\n>BERLIN, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Germany must meet NATO's 2% of GDP military spending target over the long term even after a 100 billion euro ($101 billion) special fund is used up and accept a military leadership role it earlier shied away from, its defence minister said on Monday.  \nIn a major policy shift after decades of military restraint rooted partly in Germany's bloody 20th-century history, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, announced that the fund that will lift Berlin's military spending over 2% of GDP.  \n>  \n>NATO allies have criticised Berlin strongly in the past for not reaching the 2% target, and it is unclear whether Berlin will keep its military spending over the 2% threshold once the fund is spent.  \n>  \n>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-must-meet-natos-2-spending-target-over-long-term-defence-minister-2022-09-12/\n\nGermany has refused to pull their own weight in NATO since day one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>That\u00b4s wrong as you can see here, please also note the 35 Billon from EU institutions and take a guess who pays most of this money.\n\nNo, it is not wrong.  I said Germany has barely exceeded Canada's contribution, and that is true.  Also, we were talking specifically about military aid. Also, Germany certainly contributes nothing close to \"most\" of that EU money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And since you were talking about consitency since Poland joined the EU they have been very consitent with holding their pockets open for money largley provided for by Germany to then turn around and hate on Germany with every opportunity, which as you pu it so nicely is rather unacceptable.\n\nAs previously noted, for seventy years now Germany has sat in the middle of NATO, refusing to shoulder their share of the burden of defense, while taking advantage of their neighbors -- and lately even, going out of their way to fund the operations of those attacking their supposed allies.\n\nSo, unfortunately, as I said, it is required that countries browbeat Germany into acting in a responsible fashion, because otherwise, they simply will not.  Someday, perhaps, Germany will tire of being the recalcitrant child of Europe, and get its act together, and such will no longer be required.\n\nOne can hope, anyway."

It\u2019s population growth has become stagnant if not declining, it\u2019s economy is outdated, the government is corrupt, the list goes on. They\u2019ve lost their superpower status after the collapse of the USSR and have been making their way attempting to recapture their former status. Or at the very least reduce American influence and power globally, bringing the world to a multipolar state. Ukraine is most likely their (specifically Putin\u2019s) last ditch attempt at returning to the the multipolar order. \n\nYou assume they have no ammo, you assume they\u2019re bumpkins because you\u2019ve been inundated with propaganda and you\u2019ve attached emotional support to reason and logic. That\u2019s your problem. We\u2019re talking about western tanks, it\u2019s a thread about western tanks and their influence in the war. Again, allowing your emotions and paranoia to get the better of you. Why, when, and where else would I be discussing these things? Don\u2019t look too far into things, take them at face value. \n\nAgain, I have no sympathies, objectivity is my goal. However I feel is irrelevant to reality. Being all gung-ho for Ukraine isn\u2019t going to magically make them win, the same can be said for Russia. Hating on Russia won\u2019t make them lose, the same for Ukraine.

Yes the US learned some lessons from WWII and the cold war, and has developed our military spending to account for both china and Russia as our peer rivals (militarily ofc) but America is the world superpower, not every country in  NATO has those same global strategic ambitions, like Spain, Luxemburg, Norway or Turkey. I would argue that for some nations the draw of being in the alliance is specifically being under the blanket of the massive American military umbrella, and in turn some of those countries might be more strategic in geography than in their actual fighting force, like the Bosporus straight. \n\nI agree that European countries do need to reevaluate their own defense capabilities and needs, and this war in Ukraine has made that need plain as day, I think the courage that Ukrainians are showing in the face of Russian aggression has been inspiring to many, certainly the Baltic states and Poland, plus galvanizing Sweden and Finland to apply to join which is huge for many reasons. They have already started raising those budgets.\n\nIf China attacked Taiwan the world would be in a very serious situation, much more so than just the logistical problems with supplying them with weapons, besides you'd have to get them there before any invasion anyway so kind of a moot point."

Russia is a criminal syndicate masquerading as a country. I personally knew a Russian businessman that was arrested and later killed in a fraudulent tax criminal complaint. His assets were seized and \u201csold\u201d to a group run by the very MVD officer who filed the criminal complaint for less than a kopek on the ruble. That officer was building a business empire of his own.  This is how business was done in Russia in the 2000s and nothing has changed today.  \n\nHere is the key for me: don\u2019t listen to what they say, look at how they actually do. The technologically advanced Russian armed forces was operating 50 year old tanks (not designs, actual T-72As and T-62s), trucks and BTRs with dry rotted tires, electronic warfare systems that were so bad that they were forced to turn them off, no basic logistical support to get fuel, food, and ammo to their soldiers, an Air Force unable to fly over the battlefield, cheap Iranian drones that they are forced to paid for with Su-35s (Assuming they don\u2019t end up screwing the Iranians), tanks without electronics, aircraft without integrated avionics, entire formations with only half their men, and a hundred other examples of military vranyo. It was so bad that they were forced to spread the lie that they were holding back the \u201creal\u201d varsity troops and equipment\u2026and just wait for those forces to really kick the Ukrainians ass. (Remember that lie, to cover up the lie that the RF armed forces were the \u201csecond army\u201d)\n\nBut if it is easier to imagine that what Russia says is the truth so you can just read about a topic on the internet and get your nerd on, then you do you."

Nothing. \n\nCorruption doesn\u2019t need products. Here is an example: A PMC wants a tank, they buy the tank from existing stocks of MoD tanks, everyone in the deal chain gets a cut, then the PMC contracts with the MoD (or RF in general) for a given service, the MoD pays several times the going rate for the contract, the PMC kicks back to everyone in the deal chain. The PMC eventually loses the tank and charges the MoD for equipment expenses at several times the cost of the tank, pockets the proceeds while kicking back money to everyone in the deal chain.  Note, nothing was created. The MoD got money for the tank, which they ultimately had to buy back at a premium, the PMC paid for an old tank, but ended up with more money than when they started, and the blat system ensured that the old boys network of deal makers and syndicates all got a cut. The only one that loses in this deal is the Russian people (and the three pieces of fodder in the tank). This is a simple scheme, the real deal is multilayered and might produce 5 times the value of the tank for nothing more than a broken down stripped out tank which was built by the Soviet Union 40 years ago. Building a couple tanks a month isn\u2019t going to cut it (and doesn\u2019t need more than a couple of fixers to source the components to finalize the sale\u2026even if they are shit Chinese parts and don\u2019t really do what they should)."

Speak the Truth interviews a Ukrainian  speaking ~~ex-US-army-soldier~~ (I might be misremembering this) member of the foreign legion (but not attached to the foreign legion) providing first hand accounts.  In a later clip he retells an account of his brother who is in the Armoured Forces of the UAF.  In a prior interview he mentions how ~~he ended up in the US army and his brother didn't but IIRC~~ (I might be misremembering this) they are both Ukrainian born.  Also from a prior interview he mentions how he helped train members of the UAF to use NLAW with no prior training just translating manuals and 'hacking' the Javelins to work with car batteries for training.\n\nBelow is the editted (for corrections & clarity but not editorialized) youtube transcript for anyone with shoddy internet.\n\nThis is a continuation of [the story/clip I posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/10k5o94/uaf_sf_whatever_you_need_they_have_it_language/).\n\n>So we're in the middle of this groove it's kind of Chasm I guess.  \n>  \n>It's real deep like twenty at least 20 feet 25 feet maybe and it's only four feet wide and it goes snakes like this \\[motions \"S\" Snake-like motion with single-hand\\] and it gets to the top. We're at the bottom of this thing it's perfect place where artillery can't get you. There's there's not an angle that \\[artillery\\] can just fly into it and get you and we're at the very bottom of the chasm. We cut the shelves on both sides we're sleeping in the shelves that's this tall \\[motions about 3 feet or about 1 meter\\] so really... It's a hard clay too so all the walls are very stable. You know it just you can't dig a better really better position. It was awesome!  \n>  \n>So we dug that in that's where we're hunkered for the night in the morning. We woke up went down to the vehicles. The vehicles are in the bushes right by the water. All this this position has been abandoned since we pushed the enemies like 60 kilometers past that area.  \n>  \n>\\[Just\\] So you know things I talk about is no secret by any means anymore.  \n>  \n>We parked the vehicles in in a thick brush cover them up and in the morning we're out there we had a little stove we're four kilometers from the enemy. We're in the bushes we're doing okay. We had a stove we're just cooking some food just having a good time. Him & I just chatting getting to know each other waiting for orders \\[and waiting\\] for the rest there's more guys are supposed to come that day; but again because we got engaged during the day they had to wait till night to infill \\[infiltrate\\].  \n>  \n>So sitting there talking next thing you know there's an artillery incoming right above the positions where we're taking shelter for the night. Just explosion \"bam\" and it rains the shrapnel on top of us so we kind of look at that thinking hmm... well that was strange and then \"boom\" another one and then look at him and say I wonder if they spotted the vehicles maybe from a drone like a windshield  \\[Host: \"some shine\"\\] reflection or something.  \n>  \n>I thought \"I wonder if they're after Vehicles\"... they're just trying to zero in he goes \"yeah that may be he's like we got to take cover\" because where we are is concealment there is no cover in the bushes. So we wait usually takes the tank around I don't know 20 seconds to reach there. So we wait as soon as the explosion happens we just rush to get to this one \\[foxhole\\]; get to our shelves you know take cover and they shot at us 22 times! They shot the whole carousel at us. We figured out by the explosion but the sound that there was a tank working on us; I thought \"hmm I don't think we made that many mistakes\".  How could they... how could they have found us. So we sit in there contemplating...  \n>  \n>I mean we're safe I mean I have a photo where I'm holding pieces of shrapnel that they \\[was firing\\] was raining on top of us and... Yeah maybe you can insert that photo.. I don't know it's it's a cool photo okay I'm proud of it.  \n>  \n>Umm... so we're sitting there talking and then I said \"well you know it's been quiet for an hour I'm gonna go down to the vehicle and grab some food\"... and the guy's like \"no you're not going anywhere until it's dark\".  \n>  \n>This is the difference between normal soldier and a SF \\[special forces\\]. Like he was soooo... It was...  We \\[were\\] sitting there all day we had some water we had no food. Because all the food was down there where we were cooking it & that was the difference between him and everybody else... Somebody more casual would be like oh yeah sure you know crawl or whatever be quiet; but he's like no we got spotted so we're gonna hunker down. So after this-this shots were going on for a while...  \n>  \n>He counted \\[he was counting the shots\\]. That's another thing he-he counted the shots because he wanted to know... what it you know... just wanted to know. So it was 22 times and then at the end of it he went to investigate um what's going on. He went around to this uh crack \\[in the earth probably means ditch\\] went up there and he came back.  \n>  \n>He's like hey I heard voices on top somebody was \"yelling heavy 300\"; that somebody was also yelling he's like \"what do we do?! what do we do?!\" \\[soldier from the other unit was panicking\\]. So what we come to learn that day & also that night: there was a group... \\[aside\\] We traveled... \"One\" we traveled at night \"Two\" when we moved during the day we moved along the Black Sea along the bushes. So we're in complete cover somebody from people \"we don't know\" the unit on top was walking on the plains on the higher plains they're the ones that got spotted. They happened to be above us. We had a position you couldn't possibly see us so they were walking on top of us when they got spotted and got engaged by the tank. One of them ended up being a heavy 300 \\[aside\\] (300 means uh injured); so one of them ended up being heavily wounded and he didn't make it.  \n>  \n>There was no there's no x-fill \\[exfiltrate/exfiltration for casualties\\] we got engaged 14 kilometers away... spotted. We were four kilometers now there isn't a vehicle that was going to drive out there and get him."

For EU funding and the massive benefits that come with being an EU member, they have to uphold democratic values and international rule of law the way the EU sees it.\n\nPoland is set to become a defense industry powerhouse with the tech transfers from south korea. if they dont conform to EU standards socially/legally etc, those contracts will default cause Poland just cannot afford them without EU funding. the EU fund is all about helping to catch up countries like Poland to the levels of say Germany, but in return, common values are just non-negotiable. all but 2 EU members seem happy with that arrangement\n\nTLDR. the polish ruling party is the problem for EU funding issues, as well as a myriad of economic problems including brain drain. Educated people leave states going more totalitarian, states that go anti EU etc, cause its nonsensical to wellbeing in the long run"

      "body": "The judge appointing system reforms introduced by this goverment is similar to the German one though after introduction of polish reform judical systems in both countries will be bad and in my opinion it will be a step-back for transparency of judicial system of Poland allowing for appointing judges with direct conflict of interests and blatant violation of basic separation rule between judicial and legislative power. Most of other law issues are actually related to moral matters like abortion, transexual and homosexual or women rights which should be sorted out in the treaty signed by Poland before access to the EU. Poland was given a promise such matters will be in a sole jurisdiction of local law and to change it Poland will have yo limit its legal authority while EU authority will be expanded. Such crcial changes should need equivocal support and treaties adjustment not to be a sole matter of European Council political power  Even more worrisome currently EU tries to impose some laws with typical left-wing attitude and in the future perhaps forced introduction of neocommunism in whole Europe.  It must be remembered no EU treaty gives it the right to do so and the increasing expansion of EU legal authority over member states makes look EU untrusty and even scary because it has changed given promises and gradual limitations of right to posses material goods or injust gender policies like postive discrimations of men are a sign EU might end up as a totalitarian state simar to soviet union which EU resembles little bit even now because it is governed by EU commision which members weren't selected by democratic process of allection but rather be appointed by secret voting. As for the funds EU not only gives money but also forces enormous investment on polish side into green energy in an inefficient and possibly corrupted way and it may seem Germany uses its role as top EU finsncisl contributor to solely benefit from green reforms for example by trying to adjust the law so gas imported from Russia could be considered green fuel and zero-emission nuclear power not a green energy source which coinccidently Germany is resigning from. While I personally wish we would have cleaner air in Poland it could be achieved by modernization of old polish coal power plants so according to projects over 1/4 CO2 in Poland is reduced just by increasing the efficiency of coal power plants. If we gradually added renewables and nuclear power even today we could have cut the mission by half. However wind and solar power doesn't scale efficiently above  45% of total ebergy sources due to variable rate of energy production and random energy avaiability. Even worse storage in batteries is not possible currently because of high cost of batteries and not enough lithium supply in the world. Older, heavier but cheaper batteries usually use lead which is toxic and there are risks of contamination during production and recycling. The green reforms don't take into consideration of massive disposal of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of garbage and waste produced in Western Europe and gradually exported to Easyern Europe when China and other usually poor asian countries forbid such practices which exploit the economic shortcomings of poorer countries and EU legalized this morallt questionable disposal of waste by making it impossible to stop because freedom of movement of goods is one of EU law foundations and garbage is legally treated as other goods when transferred between member states.\nThere are some ambitious ideas to stabilize electric grids in Europe by introducing one massive electrical grid so that the abundance of energy production from renewables in one country could be transferred across thousands of km within Europe but this would require tens or over hunderds of bilions of euro of investment. Very hard to finance by a single country and EU is not interested in such projects though it is perfectly suitable for this role. Instead the ecological laws are based on limiting civic rights so that animal ownership of farm animals is forbidden. Access to cars will be limited too because combustion engine cars will be forbidden to sale by 2037 as agreed by most european countries except few, surprisingly one of such cpuntries is a Germany which puts into question whether green revolution is in pursuit by this country and imposed on every smaller country in Europe by EU law because of personal interests of Germany or to protect our planet from global warming. In search for more examples historically EU forced downsizing of car engines to limit CO2 emmisions but unofficially it was done to make it harder for competition from Asia. Eventually higher capacity asian engines were refined to be as fuel efficient as the smaller europeans but more sturdy and most of the German manufacturers caused international massive scandal by falsifying the data on CO2 emissions of their cars so it turned out Germany pursuited policies requiring from other cpuntries massive ammounts of financial investmemt,  scientific and technological innovation yet their companies couldn't even meet the self-imposed ecologic limits."

      "body": "You are right that following basic human rights should not be a matter of religion or morality but the problem is what we define as the human right and who and what for creates them and whether under disquise of fighting for human rights some people and countries want to use them to enforce and expand their authority in order to fulfill their own agenda suitable for their hunger for power and money. For example did you know that Poland has punished having sexual intercouse only when it was partioned and Prussian and Russian laws were in action. After gaining the independence this law was removed and Poland simply didn't regulate it which means it couldn't be penalyzed. Homosexual intercourses in Poland were leglized formally when Nazi-Germany has conquered Poland in 1939. The right to abortion which is considered right by some EU countries and many european politicians are making an affort to make this right human right and enforce it within whole EU. The right to abortion was depenalized in Poland under Nazi-German regime and the motivation behind it wasn't the wellness and right of choice for polish women but to reduce the polish population which was to planned to be reduced by genocide of up to 80% of polish citizens and detailed in Generalplan Ost. Let's move from historical to moral context of the right to abortion. If the right to abortion is a human right why it gives the woman right to decide about whether she should have the right to decide instead of the fetus whether it should have right to live or to be destroyed. Why individual rights of fetus to live at his expense should be taken away and given to a woman ? Now while we are on women rights lets talk why if genders are equal in every dimension men are forced to serve in military in case of a war and women should not. In general for some reason I can't think of anything except hatred against men so that the so called nuclear family will be destroyed and encouragement and promotion of race mixing and immigration because some time ago Germans thought that whites are superior and now they think everybody except whites are superior. So while the concept of racial superiority is reversed it is basically the same concept and from the historical perspective people in countries like Poland with no colonies but which experienced brutal colonization from the West mostly Germany have the right to look closely at the actions of past oppressors so that they will never inflict the same policies as it was in the past. Back on topic of war against men in europe it is quite obvious they are discriminated and the EU has formalized and executed this morally doubtful practices by writing them down in a form of laws and made them legally binding in every EU country to follow these laws which they don't even hide because they publicly and shamelessly calling these laws a positive discrimation. They justify this by historical discrimination of women by men which are treated as a group not individuals. One of female swedish MPs in a country which scores in the very top in EU rankings in terms of human and woman rights once claimed publically all men are potential rapists and should be treated as such. This is morally but also legislatively wrong because human rights conventions consider punishing a group for invididual crimes as a crime against humanity, similarly punishing individuals for crimes done in the past by related individuals or members of a group like family, tribe or nation is considered a crime against humanity too. The best example of skewed morality expressed in harmfulness of some EU laws are the laws pursuited during refugee crisis. By international law the person fills the definition of a refugee if he meets certain humanitarian criteria and is entitled to this status in the first country it flees. By breaking this law and trying to impose refugee quotas on every european country it was the EU which broke the  rule of law because of ideological blindess and the need for spreading the once right idealogy which is communism. Recently in just one month polish border was crossed by few millions of ukrainian refugees and over 1 400 000 have stayed in Poland yet this time EU didn't want to impose refugee quotas making a case for double standards by treating some countries as more privileged and now by treating Poland as less privileged. What is really detestful is that most EU politicians justfied and even helped to gain unlawfully the right to  refugee status by helping by threatening with legal actions and financial punishments to Poland when belorussian regime used economic middle eastern mostly well-dressed physically fit young males to attack and pass polish border. It didn't matter that polish border guards and soldiers from voluntary territorial defence forces were attacked, many of them harmed but it mattered Poland won't execute its law to protect tertitorial integrity and follows the rules of international law regarding gaining the refugee status. So when belorusdian regime used demographic weapons against Poland just before ukrainian-russian war european institutions and politicians stood against Poland, calling it rascist basing this prejudice on the stereotypical thinking that Poles are xenophobic against people from distant parts of world and demanding a punishment for Poland for defending its border and pushing back the trespasseurs back into Belorussian territory. As history recently showed Poland stood on the right side and country with a population of 38 millions took almost the same amount of refugees in weeks which 500 million Europe took in 2 years. Of course eventually the majority of real ukrainian refugees moved back to their country or to other richer EU countries but still at the outbreak of this crisis some journalists claimed falsely that Poland is not allowing to enter people with dark or black skin and this lie was a disinformation spread by russian propaganda which which went viral among western european countries by media which wants to believe Eastern Europeans are racist and probably because white western europeans feel guilt for their colonial past and mistreatment of people of other races by their ancestors and institutional and judicial racism and now they want to fight with racism by making polish nation a bunch of racists just because of right to fight for Poland a coutnry which had no history of colonialism and no systemic and institutional racism and racist laws."

The Germans have become reliant on very cheap energy. The Germans believed the liberalization of Russia (and hence improved European security) would be a natural outcome of a strong German-Russian relationship. \n\nUnfortunately, Russia is a criminal organization that masquerades as a nation.

They are doing what you claim they can\u2019t do except it\u2019s infinitely more complicated because it\u2019s piecemeal bullshit instead of us just giving them what\u2019s needed and billing the Europeans for it when this is over."

So no, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to question Ukraine\u2019s ability to fuel, fix, arm and man these incredibly complex systems.\n\nUkraine can only Macguyver this stuff for so long before they culminate.\n\nYou keep talking about scale. A few batteries is nothing for scale. They don\u2019t need the best stuff, they need lots of stuff that they can keep running so that they can mass. \n\nIt\u2019s 100% reasonable to question their ability to keep enough Abrams running to give them the mass they need."

You are saying it is easier to maintain twenty different platforms than just 1 and that they can\u2019t maintain paladins\u2026 we are giving them paladins and Bradley\u2019s that are the same platform along with m270s they already have. IF they can\u2019t maintain them then how are they maintaining them? Your service in a peacetime military has 0 bearing on what the Ukrainians are dealing with. \n\nYou said they can\u2019t maintain them even though they are currently doing exactly that go ahead and counter that point then explain how maintaining platforms from around 6 different countries during a war for survival for doesn\u2019t show their maintenance abilities?  \n\nIn my estimation these people have more experience in a true war than the United States has they are in a peer conflict with 6 figure casualties it\u2019s insulting to compare your experience to theirs."

How the fuck can they not maintain paladins which once more we are giving them now btw so apparently the United States thinks they can maintain them. \n\nMy plan was that the United States should have given them a few divisions worth of equipment instead of a hodgepodge from every country in the west then train them for a year so they have a spring offensive. You then said they couldn\u2019t be taught to maintain that equipment which is insulting and fucking dumb considering they are currently keeping a few of every fucking system the west has to offer in the fight along with ancient soviet garbage.

Unless Russia starts having some major breakthroughs and ukraine starts losing a lot of equipment there will be a point where Russian meat is being harvested in ridiculous numbers by the Ukrainians and morale will be almost gone. HIMARS already messed up the heads of a lot of Russians, but getting chewed up by the precision and the programable ammunition of the Bradley\u2019s, Strykers and CV-90s will seriously wear them down. Plus if they can get their hands on tanks it\u2019s almost inevitable that quality over quantity will really start to show it\u2019s value.

So to them, at some point they UA will be at a straining point to where they would be unable to launch offensive attacks and just resort to holding the defensive lines. We are seeing a little bit of this now."

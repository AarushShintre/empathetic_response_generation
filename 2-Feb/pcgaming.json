This of course is purely the *mentality*, there are differences in practice between the two (the fact that GPUs are more of a necessity than Beanie Babies and the informal price collusion between AMD and Nvida which gives both reasonable certainty they can outlast any wait.), but the analogy should give you a picture as to why they aren't lowering prices.\n\n>If it were mere greed, as you say, the greedy person would take as much money as they could get (above cost), especially for a product that has such a short shelf life.

I'll definitely keep it on my radar and ty for recommending it. Just don't know if the controls/playstyle (looks like you have really exaggerated movements and the game looks a bit choppy) would fit what we're looking for right now. Also \"coolness\" is a big factor. The overall environment of the game seems muddled and dark which I can tell fits the game perfectly but we're kinda looking for a more crisp looking game with detailed refined enemies (take for example, the Dauntless bosses, the Hades art, Elden ring boss detailing and cool features. +Weapons and armor which don't only have cool effects but also cool looks.

It also explains very well why FOV should be mandatory. Also, it explains why not including is detrimental to EVERYONE, because of the varying screen sizes gamers play on. If EVERYONE used the same monitor, and sat the same distance from it, FOV wouldn't matter as much. But even from a non-accessability viewpoint, not including FOV adjustment actually detracts from the artistic vision of the game. \n\nAnd I do count adjustable camera distance as a form of FOV adjustment. So yes, all those games support FOV adjustment without patches on PC."

Definitely get a new drive. Even if the bad sectors aren't terrible now, they might get worse quickly.\n\nHowever, your system is almost certainly installed on C, along with probably most of your programs. The new drive will be empty, and copying things over is not very easy depending on your expertise. There is software that can do clone an OS to another drive (maybe Stella Drive Monitor can? if not, Macrium Reflect).\n\nOtherwise you'd need to reinstall Windows and all of your programs. Anything on D will stay though.\n\nI will be completely honest, I am not 100% sure that this will fix your game crashing.\n\nIdeally, if you have time and the know-how, you would install a fresh copy of Windows, either on a new partition on the D drive or on a new SSD, and try playing the game.\n\nThat way your C drive is out of the equation, and if the game still crashes it must be something else hardware related.\n\nThere are plenty of resources on Youtube on how to create partitions, install Windows, and so on. I could also help you out, but if you feel this is way over your head, you should take your PC to a local PC repair store. It's unfortunate that this happened to a brand new PC, you're really unlucky."

This isn't a discussion on whether we have similar views on trademark.\r\n\nWhich you built entirely on a misunderstanding on your part, and given how hostile you seem to be I was trying to extend an olive branch by pointing out that it seems to me that we agree on the issue regarding trademarks that it seems silly to get caught up on what is just a misunderstanding of what I said.\n\n>Your earlier posts make it seem like you don't and your continued push to try and go on a tangent about other non-relevant points is just frustrating the issue.\r  \n\r\n\nI'm not the one to bring up non-relevant points though.

If it doesn't, there is a key you can press during boot (basically keep tapping the key until something happens) that will open the boot menu and let you select the USB. Most of the time that key is F8 or F12 but it could be different on your PC.\n\nWhen in the installer, you can use the license key you've used for the previous OS, or continue with a free version for now, if you don't have that key anymore. Then you have a window with drive selection, [like this](https://www.groovypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/09-Select-Primary-Partition-640x480.png). Select the SSD here (make sure it's the right one), and the install will continue.\n\nOnce installed, you can remove the old OS by typing \"disk cleanup\" into the search. It will scan the HDD and give you an option to remove old Windows versions or something like that.\n\nIf you reuse your old license key, you might have to re-activate it. I'm not sure how to do that, last time I had to do this was 10 years ago and back then I had to call a Microsoft number and tell them the license key, then they would give me a special code to put in to activate the OS."

It doesn't matter if it's Witcher or Assassin's Creed it's boring and repetitive either way. \n\nAnd the game forces you to sit though all of these same missions to progress to the next area.\n\nElden Ring imo did progression correctly, if you are efficient in how you place your points as you level up, you can easily defeat enemies while underleveled. \n\nBOTW is another game which was extremely fun and rewarded exploration. \n\nTBF Both of these games did not have micro transactions."

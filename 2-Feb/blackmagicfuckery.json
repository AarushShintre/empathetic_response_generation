Do the same thing you did at the beginning with that ball in your hand, pretend to put it into the other hand but keep it palmed, then pretend to put it from that other hand under cup 2.

When you turn it back down drop the palmed ball under it. Take the last ball from the ground, do the same fake transfer, pretending to put it into your other hand but really keeping it in the original hand, tap that hand with the wand, show the ball has vanished. Turn over cup 2 which already has a ball under it to show that the ball has appeared there.

There are two cards face up on the bottom of the the face down deck prior to when he splits the deck, second from bottom and third from bottom. When he splits the deck and brings the original bottom packet over the top packet, he drops two cards from the bottom on top of the top packet before turning both packets over. So the card that you see the back of when the packet is turned over is the the card that was third from the bottom, the second face up card on the bottom which is also the selected card. So after you have done the split and dropped the two cards and then turned both packets over, you are in a situation where one packet has a face down card on top and all the cards under it are face up. The other packet has all cards from the top face up and only the bottom card face down, so when the two packets are mixed together there are only two cards that are differently oriented than the rest, the top card of one packet and the bottom card of the other, if you turn both packets over when they are interlacked its the opposite, you have a face up card in one and the others are face down, and the other packet has face down cards and the bottom card is the face up one. One of these differently oriented cards is the selection, the one that has its back outwards. So now you need to only turn one of these cards over and all cards except the selected card are the same way.\n\nThis trick is Larry Jenning's outstanding triumph."

A current won't exist without a voltage, but knowing a voltage won't tell you how much current you get.\n\nIt's like applying the formula for a sphere to the design of a wing. \n\nOr to give your bullet analogy, it's like saying the weight of a bullet doesn't kill you, but the energy does. If a bullet has a given energy, I know roughly how much harm it might do to my body. Now, for that energy, it needs a certain mass and a certain velocity, but knowing either one individually won't help.

The value used for R could be the resistance of an ideal resistor, or, using complex analysis, could be extended to solve for the impedance of frequency-dependent electrical components, such as capacitors or inductors. For example, the impedance for an ideal capacitance is given by 1/j\u03c9C, where j is the imaginary unit (square root of -1), \u03c9 (omega) is the signal frequency in radians, and C is the capacitance in Farads. As the frequency increases, 1/j\u03c9C gets smaller, the impedance of the capacitance goes down, and the current for a given voltage will increase.  \n\n\n>Your body is not a resistor.\n\nNobody is making this claim. A simple question was asked by someone who was genuinely curious, and so some simplifications were made to give an answer that was easier to spark intuition from. Treating the body as having resistance to electricity is not the same as saying \"the body is a resistor\". You're essentially lecturing me for telling someone the world is a sphere by saying \"well ackshully it's an oblate spheroid\". Thank you for your contribution.  \n\n\n>How much current you get for a given potential depends on a huge number of factors, such as:\n\nThis is correct... because... these things affect the body's resistance to electricity in a number of different ways, which in turn affects the amount of current that's generated from a given voltage.  \n\n\n>A current won't exist without a voltage\n\nThank you. That's really the only point I've been trying to make.  \n\n\n>knowing a voltage won't tell you how much current you get.\n\nCorrect. You need to know the voltage and the resistance of the material to which a voltage is applied. At the same time, it's impossible to know the current that will flow without knowing the voltage.  \n\n\n>It's like applying the formula for a sphere to the design of a wing.\n\nYou've said this a couple times so far and I still don't know what you mean.

[NASA has a page on this very topic](https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/beginners-guide-to-aeronautics/ideal-lift-of-a-spinning-ball/).\n\nI enjoy talking about this kind of stuff and am happy to continue doing so, but I do know what I'm talking about."

This formula only works for a ***linear, time-invariant*** electrical network.\n\nA body is not that.\n\nIt's also not particularly helpful if the resistor were to be damaged by a maximum current (rather than power), and you didn't know if you had a 100 ohm resistor or a 1M resistor. That's literally how much variance you commonly see in the skin junction in impedance. \n\n>A simple question was asked by someone who was genuinely curious, and so some simplifications were made to give an answer that was easier to spark intuition from.

If someone told you, for an LED, \"it's not the voltage, it's the current,\" it'd be correct, although for the opposite reason. There is *some* dependence of current on voltage, and you need a current to produce a voltage, but the voltage across a diode is *relatively* constant. If you drive a diode with a voltage source, you're liable to get not enough current or to blow it up with relatively small variations in voltage or between devices.

That's really the only point I've been trying to make.\n\nAnd you made it using the wrong equation, and the wrong logic. You can't define a diode by V=IR either.

True it is a bit unusual, when we first started hanging out we were both fresh out of shitty relationships so I think paying for things was my way of still feeling valuable to someone, it's just something that never phased out I guess, but it's mostly small things like coffee/breakfast/lunch things under 40$ but lately it's been rather expensive in an effort to cheer her up \ud83d\ude05. It is possible I may have feelings on a small scale I do love her as a friend no question, we do rely on each other for emotional support quite often when I have guy/girl troubles and she's having guy troubles, even non relationship troubles.

There is a list of visa types, legnths and rules and I'm sure there is one for your situation that may be much more beneficial.

I'm much, much better off without him in my life- I wish it didn't take me until I was 30 to realize it, but it is what it is.\n\nI do know some people who had very strained relationships with their parents that got remarkably better as they entered adulthood- parents are fallible just like anyone else, and they can make well-meaning mistakes with their kids that put a damper on any day-to-day interactions.\n\nPersonally, I'd wait to see how your friend's family reacts to him being distant/gone; a well-meaning parent may be confused, but will try to keep the lines of communication open and not be too harsh on someone they love. A parent that's more into themselves will widen that gap with blame, manipulation, or shallow bribes.

One could reasonably argue that you saying you are surprised they have friends is much ruder.\n\nJust because something hurts doesn\u2019t make it bullying. I\u2019m sorry you have a difficult time with other people and making friends. It\u2019s really worth continuing to try and get better at. It\u2019s a skill that is possible to develop. Some people have a much easier time of it and others have a much more difficult time of it. I\u2019ve learned I\u2019m good at meeting new people and starting a friendship but then very bad at maintaining friendships for any length of time. It takes a lot of intentionality and mental effort on my part to do it. But it\u2019s ok, I keep focusing on improving.\n\nMy oldest son is autistic and it\u2019s been difficult for him to make friends, especially with kids his own age. I practice having social interactions with him and have to work through subtlety and emotional and nonverbal cues with him, it\u2019s a massive struggle for him and does not come naturally at all. He\u2019s worked with psychotherapists and behavioral therapists and it\u2019s helped him immensely. I also noticed that his anxiety made his ADHD and ODD much more severe and asked his doctor about anxiety medication. It was a huge help for him. All this to say, you may really want to seek professional help as there can be a lot of underlying differences that make socializing much more difficult for you than others, and treating or addressing those underlying issues may radically change your experiences."

We know that it's not healthy, and we're working on it in our own way.

The only lung recovery I ever saw was several weeks after I quit putting nicotine into my lungs completely and started consciously training cardio every other day\n\nMy main grievance is with people who pretend vaping is just water, or that it's harmless, or that it isn't a dick move to do inside, or that ignore asthmatics telling them it affects them. Just because it's \"less harmful than smoking\" doesn't mean it's inert, and doesn't mean it can't cause lung damage or breathing problems. \n\nI don't think it's an effective cessation tool because of my own experience and  realizing how habit forming it is to have in your hand at all times and keep under your pillow at night, but people can try anything they want.

Unfortunately the bad actors get all the attention.\n\nI'm personally at odds with how vaping should be accessible, because I agree with the attempts to limit access to kids and non-smokers, but I personally advocate for the cessation success it has had with many other users. And I recognize that easier accessibility plays a factor in one's ability to try different methods. I don't have an answer to that, but it's been over vilified, imo."

But with boundaries. This would be a boundary for me. I've been someone with 2 years, continuously shown them I'm loyal, always showed my phone and yet they don't even acknowledge the fact I've done nothing to earn their distrust. At that point it's no longer my responsibility, at that point I have a choice: accept this person as they are, or tell them that it will not work for me like this. I can choose to help them, take on a responsibility that I don't have to, and try to support them in working things through. But I don't have to. I can also break up and find a partner that makes my life less difficult.\n\nThat last possibility is why it is so important for him, and anyone in a similar situation, to realise they need to get themselves together. Nobody is going to help them if they don't try and help themselves first. And they will lose out on real life opportunities if they don't help themselves first. I was in that situation.

Teams with worse defenses will have less TOP because they can't get the ball back. Situational football will change a lot of data. These numbers don't exist in a vacuum. \n\nWhy **wouldn't you** include every majority passer in the data set? What do you have to lose by that? If you wanted to weight it you should be doing pass play % or something that better compares across sample size differences. \n\nExamining inequalities is hard. More data isn't bad, especially when your question is as simple as measuring statistically provable data to composite it. 10 games is a big enough sample size where if someone is top 5, it's very very unlikely that it's an accident. \n\nIf someone is starting 15 games, your should really be adjusting your threshold to accept that. Even if they better passed, you still want to compare their passing when they did throw. \n\nIf you wanted to go with your query, picking a fixed standard would be a fine cutoff. \"top 25% of the league by pass attempts per game started\" or top 50%.

You're either measuring them at a certain volume, or you are measuring their efficiency when they did pass. \n\nYou're outright ignoring efficiency and saying it's a volume criteria, but your criteria has several basic biases in it that don't even account for team play style, or things like Jacoby having a fixed time window where he can play regardless of how good his performance is, or that it was 3/4 of the year. \n\nThat's just wild to me."

Wilson is not perfect. far from it. he makes mistakes he needs to improve on and mature as being a leader and take accountability when he has to. But you and the whole jets are the reason why no rookie QB can ever succeed in that horrible dumpster fire of a franchise, because all you do from day 1 is point fingers and blame him when he a) is not the main reason why the team struggled (hint: from week 9 and later) and b) trusting the process and being content that this was never a year to push for the playoffs but the future is bright and the team is heading into the right direction. He needs the games, the experience, and the development. And this failure of a franchise and fanbase has nothing else than to call for his head and make him the scapegoat. \n\nAnd now that you have proven on top of all that, you have proven that you are an immature little kid who starts insulting the other party when you clearly havent done your research but instead gets butthurt when someone calls you out for it. i wont return to this anymore. take a deep dive into your ignorance, idgaf."

It doesn\u2019t matter if you have the team of the century for 20 years straight you don\u2019t win 7 if you aren\u2019t good at qb\n\nWhat I'm saying is the flip side is true as well. It doesn't matter how good your QB play is, if your defense lets you down you go home. If your special teams lets you down, you go home. Lots of QBs, great ones, have led the go ahead TD only to watch their defense crumble.  Plenty of mediocre QBs have won Super Bowls as well. Eli Manning is not better than Dan Marino. \n\nIf Tom Brady was the king of playoff per game stats and he still won 7 rings then you could make the argument. You see it with Jordan because he won 6, but is the career PPG post season leader. He was the best player of the court for every single one of those post season championship and he played defense. \n\nTom Brady wasn't. He's 20th in post season passer rating, right next to Joe Flacco and Joe Theismann. It goes both ways though too, because one of his most impressive playoff runs, he lost to the Eagles because the Patriots gave up 41 points. If they give up 31 Tom Brady has 8 SBs but is exactly the same QB. \n\nTom Brady is great for a lot of reasons, but SB wins are a team stat.

Does it help? It absolutely does, no idea why you aren\u2019t giving it credit. The QB leads the team to victory, not just in the SB but throughout the season. That\u2019s game in and game out impact - on the field and off it. \n\n\nSaying Brady could have won one more Super Bowl and been the same QB is very much different than comparing someone with 1 Super Bowl to 7. Come on. \n\n\nMJ was surrounded by an insane team which is ironic given that you discredit Brady for the same reason, but ok.PPG is a hard stat in a game with 5 v 5. It\u2019s a pretty damn good method to measure impact. Is passer rating or QB rating? Absolutely not. Multiple people can score (running game), stats can get skewed, value can be lost in the formula, etc. \n\n\nFor example, Brady could know exactly who to throw it to where to secure a first down in a crucial part of the game and not get additional credit in either formula. Know how to manage that drive to march the ball down with sufficient time to score but too little to give the other team much of a chance to counter, etc. that\u2019s all intangible. You\u2019ll never see this reflected on stat sheets it\u2019s just immense game IQ that leads to wins, QB and Passer rating mean nothing. Some of the highest QBR games were pretty shit games. I\u2019m the video game world we call it gamesense, Brady was the the best at it and it made the difference in winning games. NFL coaches call it \u201cintangibles\u201d, something they spend endless hours trying to spot in players. The NFL scouts are looking for something that you apparently don\u2019t think exists because Passer Rating or QBR don\u2019t support Brady winning 7 Super Bowls so it just have been him getting carried by the team. He just happened to luck into 7 SB wins and 10 appearances because of stacked teams, right. Teams equally stacked would be lucky to get 3 appearances in a generation.

Tom Brady doesn't play defense. In that AFC championship game I mentioned, Tom Brady scored the go ahead TD. His next two drives to end the game were 1 pass where he threw a pick and another one where he went 3 and out. \n\nHow did his game sense and intangibles win that game? What about 2002 when the defense stopped the Titans and returned the punt into FG range for Vinitari? Or was his 1/4 passing for 4 yards key to winning that drive? Or 2015 when the Patriots stopped the Ravens from scoring the go ahead TD with a great interception? Tom Brady did that too? If Flacco scores there, is Brady worse? Is he worse if Ty Law doesn't get that pick-6 to beat the Rams? Cause Brady didn't score enough to win. \n\nMJ was surrounded by an insane team, but he was always the best player on the court and the box score showed it. Tom Brady has won more games playing worse than other greats won when they played great. \n\nAll this isn't to say that Tom Brady isn't great, because he is. But a big reason he won was because he had an excellent team around him that came up big when they needed to.

Like I\u2019m not even trying to be a sarcastic ass. \n\n\nCompletion percentage when Brady started was on average 10% lower than it is now. YPG 10% lower than it is now. TD/game 10% lower than it is now (most seasons). Interceptions 20% less are thrown now than 20 years ago. INT % down 30% now compared to then. QB rating 10-15% higher now compared to then. \n\n\nI can go on and on. So while you sit here saying he\u2019s statistically not the best, while he\u2019s statistically quite good. And you don\u2019t bother to consider the evolution of the game and how his stats will be lower as EVERYONES stats were lower 10-20 years ago. Then you don\u2019t consider that he played to 45 so stat averages wouldn\u2019t be his strong suit as other QBs who retire 10 years earlier. Then you don\u2019t consider any of the intangibles, leadership, pay cuts for better teams, etc. \n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to really say. You\u2019re looking at a current stat sheet, a single piece of paper, and trying to determine something without even analyzing the data. And ultimately the game is about winning which he did, and was massively impactful in doing so. Nobody is arguing it\u2019s not a team sport but you\u2019re the only one arguing he somehow stumbled into 7SBs while being the person who had his hand on the ball every damn play. \n\n\nAccording to your logic we have 3-4 NFL all time goat quarterbacks right now in the nfl, some of which have only been playing 2 or 3 seasons."

So if we remove his early years and only look at the 2009 season to now, his passer rating goes up 1.3 points, he's still in 20th place but he is closer to Joe Theismann than he was before. \n\nBut if we are going to era adjust for TB, we should also consider QBs who played their entire career in older eras and were close, but not higher than TB. Guys like Troy Aikman who was only 1.5 passer rating lower than Tom Brady and played in a harder era for QBs. \n\nAlso guys like Bart Starr or Joe Montana who are way ahead of Tom Brady statistically and played in an harder era.  If we era adjust them, they get even further ahead of Tom Brady. \n\nYou keep seeing to think I'm saying Tom Brady sucks and he stumbled into 7 SBs. Rather, I'm saying he is a HOF QB who was fortunate enough to play with good enough teams to win 7 SBs.\n\nHe doesn't have the individual accomplishments of someone like Gretzky to set his individual play so far apart from anyone else. In no other major sport do we consider the player with the most titles to be the best player. No one is arguing that Bill Russell is the best player of all time. Why? Because stats like this: There have been 12 seasons when a player was the scoring champ and the 1st team all defense. The one season Jerry West did it, the two times Kobe Bryant did it and the nine times Michael Jordan did it. Gretzky is the only player to have a 200 point season and he did it four times. \n\nTom Brady's most impressive accomplishment is his longevity and his volume stats. He's a shoe in Hall of Famer, but he isn't the Gretzky of the NFL. He isn't the Jordan of the NFL. He's a great player who was lucky enough to be on a great team. Lots of great players, who played better, were not so lucky."

Every site has him at 10, the NFL HOF website has him at 3. The sites with him in 10th show that every person above him played after him (usually starting their career within the last 6 years) and benefited from passer rating inflation (save maybe Brees). The only people even close to him on the list who started before he did are Steve Young and Peyton Manning, Brady is listed higher than them. Young retired at 38 and Manning at 39. \n\n\nSo Brady has two other goat QB\u2019s beat in all time passer rating while playing 6-7 years more post prime than they did. And not just regular post prime but 40+ year old post prime, where he also led his teams to 2 additional super bowls. \n\n\nIf you\u2019re gonna list your stats at least know what they are saying."

Impossible to retroactively diagnose the first (possible/probable) concussion once the Cincy situation happens.

You keep talking contradictions, apparently Hurts is just a guy because Minshew was able to put up 27 points against the Cowboys, but when he plays the Saints \"it's not even his fault, they had the ball the whole game!\"  Continue to call me a slow individual yet your big brain keeps saying \"they had the ball all game\". [They all had the ball all game because Minshew went 3-and-out four straight drives.] (https://i.vgy.me/8RPvUL.png) Also going back to your previous statement of \"that was more on your d that game\", if a defense allows only 13 points yet their offense being stagnant the entire game, the defense did miracles. \n\n> I\u2019m not sure hurts would have done much better\n\nYes he would have LMAO. Again you clearly look at box scores, Minshew played horrible because he had happy feet all day long and constantly was hesitating. Hurts even with his sprained shoulder would've been able to muster out something better than four 3-and-outs in a row. Keep telling me Hurts is just a guy yet Minshew with the same team that put up 27 points on the Cowboys failed to do any work against the Saints the following week."

I would definitely agree that it doesn\u2019t make sense to routinely take one of DK and Lockett off the field but being able to effectively pass out of a heavy 3 TE set (that is almost certainly a run look to any defense) is a great wrinkle to have.

We aren\u2019t going to try to hit a go route with 3 TEs usually, it\u2019s more the intermediate stuff that TEs feast on, and we are making you very concerned about the run game because we have 8 big dudes on the field. \n\nYoure obviously gonna bring a safety down and play us in your base, but who covers who if you call man? The 3 TEs could see a CB, a S, or a LB depending on the matchup. If we know how to leverage those mismatches we can absolutely wreak havoc in the pass game on play action because we made the run your #1 problem with the formation. \n\nThat\u2019s my theory anyway. It\u2019s the unfamiliarity of it and the way running out of that big personnel group dictates a defenses scheme and priorities. \n\nWould still rather do the same idea with two TEs so we can keep Lockett and DK on the field together too though.

I highly doubt what he is saying is true. To me it doesn't make any sense whatsoever that the memory being full means you are unable to access the application - typically that means you have to delete some and it will be freed. Not being able to *add* would make sense but if anything, the delete option is the one option that would still remain. If the memory was full at the time of you sending it that would make total sense for it to not be there... but you could easily ask him for proof of that. (Ask to show a screenshot of his archive at the time)\n\nLogically, there is no reason to \"not be able to look\" at a photos app. Even if the memory is full, you can usually access it still. I never used Xiaomi Cloud but it probably works just like the other apps that I have used.\n\nThat being said, if he doesn't want to do anything about it, and it's in his control (or even if it isn't) - there's nothing that can be done for you now. You have to manage that anxiety like everyone else is saying.\n\nIt's really difficult, but try to focus on the fact that it's unlikely it will be leaked.

That alone makes him not a good man.\n\n>If he says there's nothing on that cloud, he doesn't want to bother checking it out.\n\nHe's within his right to not check, true, but it doesn't make him not an asshole when it very clearly bothers you. If he doesn't care when it clearly bothers you (and your concern IS a rational one, by the way) then he is a callous monster. Simple. This is something very important to you and actively harms your well-being, so if he cared about you he would look into it with you instead of handwave your \"paranoia\" away (it isn't paranoia if it's true).  I wouldn't call this paranoia at all.\n\n> He knows nothing's written down and he's telling me so. I am underage in these photos, I told him it would be his fault if the photos were leaked in any way and he would be held responsible, but he reassured me that they were not on his phone and he would feel stupid to keep them after our relationship.\n\nIt's really good news that he sent you screenshots and tried to reassure you, but sometimes predators do that to appease without actually addressing the issue. The only thing you can do now is trust his word on it since it's clear he won't be taking any action. It's true - he would be responsible if it was leaked. But you've learned a valuable lesson: don't put yourself in a position to be controlled like that unless you're able to deal with the possible ramifications.\n\n>He's a good man, but immature. He wouldn't hurt me.\n\nThis sounds like the justification of a battered wife. The truth is abusive behaviors are surprisingly commonplace, and it doesn't always have to be explicit physical abuse to be abusive. Simply not caring can be tantamount to an abusive ideology - because it enables the abuse. It's a common behavior but that doesn't make it okay to do to you.\n\n>And I was naive, now I can't trust people like I used to because of this whole situation. Honestly, I feel like an idiot, I'm afraid that in a few years I will suffer the consequences for all this. I suffer everyday because of this mistake. \n\nThis is your *real* problem. You were vulnerable, but any kind of intimate connection is going to be vulnerable. You were set up to fail by society that told you that you should unequivocally trust people and called you paranoid the second you had a valid concern. \n\n\nNone of this is really your fault. You don't have to beat yourself up for it. This is the piece that is up to you to maintain because this is the part that is in your control. You're not an idiot for trusting when you thought you should. It's a human thing to trust.\n\nYou don't have to worry about the consequences from years down the line, though, because you can't predict the future. When I'm in a situation like this I remind myself that it hasn't happened yet. Make a mental plan for *if* it happens, then continue on with the rest of your life as best you can because that's all you can control. And like I said, it's *okay* to be 'paranoid' for a while. Anxiety is a very useful thing because otherwise we wouldn't have it. Just can't let it dictate your life before the bad thing occurs."

I guarantee you if you had pulled that on him, he would\u2019ve pitched a fit, and these one-sided negotiations they expect are so, so inequitable. When I see men ruthlessly negotiating on app like this, I can\u2019t help but be angry about the negotiation double standard, and this reminded me of that. \n\nAnd no, it *should not* be transactional, theoretically. The problem is, to most men, it *is*. But what makes it even worse is they want to make that transaction one-sided\u2026.he enters negotiations for good terms (sex) for himself, and\u2026and you are just to take what you get (which may involve dangling \u201cthe relationship carrot\u201d meaning, he holds the cards in that you assume sexual risk on him and then maybe, if he feels like it, at some point, he\u2019ll emotionally and/or financially invest in you, if he\u2019s incentivized to do so) without any negotiation on your part to benefit as much as he is. \n\nWhen a man is more interested in what you can do for him, than who you are- and that is common- it is a transaction. A transaction where he benefits and you devalue what you offer is still a transaction\u2026it\u2019s just an exploitative one instead of an equitable one. \n\nYou\u2019ll see. I want a world for you where men meet you on your terms, you just get together, and get to know each other. But I\u2019m saying- and I\u2019ve interacted with thousands of men on apps before I stopped a year ago- your sweet, good faith approach is not how most men are coming into this on app. They are looking to get down to business and figure out how they can benefit here. They don\u2019t want to hear about how you, in turn, would be interested in him deeply caring about you as a person (enough to where the answer to the question of \u201cWould it hurt him to hurt me?\u201d is \u201cYes! Very much so!\u201d). And if you have sex with him early? Yes, he is getting the better deal, because you\u2019re taking on the bulk of the symptomatic STD/pregnancy/no orgasm/nonconsensual act/involuntary hormonal bonding risk. When you assume that much disproportionate risk, you are providing the other person with a *lot* of value. And I just hope you\u2019ll keep that value you are offering in mind, because few are worthy of it. \n\nI wrote another comment about how men approach matches on apps, [it is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/10sptbj/how_do_you_deal_with_objectification/j72w3hz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)"

Pretend they\u2019re not being transactional? \n\nWhen the value of time with a human woman is reduced to their resources, the only equitable option (well, you can just not date, but this will rule out 95% of men), is to reduce men to resources in return. If this man- if these *men*- valued women as people independent of the sex they might provide,  that would be super! But they don\u2019t do that. They want something of tremendous value to them, with significant risk to women\u2026without investing anything in kind that would help women feel like \u201cthis is equitable\u201d. \n\nWhat can men provide in return to make things equitable and fair? Not sex, there is little value- lots of risk, little reward, and you can get it anywhere. Their hearts/emotional investment? But that may not show up for months down the road (imagine if the cultural standard was for women to also not have sex for months down the road, and his emotional risk and her sexual risk had to be assumed *at the same time*!). And how emotionally invested can a man who reduces women to sexual availability really be? \n\nYour final sentence- getting to know each other before sex, money, or emotions are invested- yes, of course. Before even *talking* about investments, it should be- \u201cHey! First of all? Who are you? What are you like?\u201d In a just world, this would be the norm.\n\nBut I am talking about what *is*, not what *ought* to be. Does your ideal scenario sound like what\u2019s happening with the man in OP\u2019s post? Or does it sound like he\u2019s immediately launched into negotiating a deal for himself? I\u2019d say the latter. And in my experience? Men are doing this the majority of the time, negotiating the best possible deal for themselves on the basis of what they want most (sex), at the expense of simply getting acquainted with the human, as you suggest.\n\nMany men will counter this by saying, but if it\u2019s not going to be a good deal for me, what is the point in getting to know a woman? Fine. But then all I\u2019m asking is (why you personally may choose not to as you find it distasteful, which, fair), if it is acceptable and normal for men to ruthlessly inquire in opening convos about what human resource benefits in dating they might procure\u2026.why may not women do the same with the resources that are valuable to *them* (financial assistance, emotional commitment), without being slammed for it?"

I have encountered this mindset in in-person interactions as well (particularly when alcohol is involved), but it can be reduced somewhat when a man *has* to get to know a woman first (common connections, same community, etc.) before any conversations about how she may serve can ever take place. \n\nI guess it is just so common, I have little hope of men changing. And when these gentle feminine souls come into TwoX again, and again, and again, projecting their empathy on men that don\u2019t possess it, dumbfounded they are reduced to their sexuality, it is heartbreaking to see that most girls aren\u2019t taught that this is the general way of the male dating perspective, there will be plenty more where that came from, and if she wants to date men, she\u2019d better get used to it. If a woman doesn\u2019t like the power imbalance, the options are to either play their transactional game and negotiate terms right back so at least you\u2019re not exploited, or, hardly date men at all. \n\nI just read a fantastic easy read of a book called [Rethinking Sex, by Christine Emba](https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Sex-A-Provocation/dp/B097CJW92H/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?crid=MF9J2IHU1WRS&keywords=rethinking+lg+sex&qid=1675644635&sprefix=rethinkin+lg+sex%2Caps%2C86&sr=8-1) that dives into the aforementioned dehumanization, and how it is mitigated as you say by offline meetings, which affords less anonymity and more accountability."

If I twisted and turned in my sleep and somehow ended up on my right side the jolt of pain would wake me up \ud83e\udd72\n\nI really hope that in the end everything ends up healing the way it's supposed to. No one should have to go through all of this bullshit."

Missing 2 or more pills, particularly in the first week, is when pregnancy starts to become more likely.\n\nFrom your report, I am guessing you had menses prior, was on day 6 of COCP, did not miss any doses, and immediately took plan B afterwards, thus I think it\u2019s less likely for pregnancy. If your periods are delayed by more than a week then it\u2019s worth looking into though."

I was never taught anything about birth control throughout my life and my mother had me on it as soon as I started menstruating and told me so many lies about it for some reason. My mom always told me that if I ever become bloated or nauseous on the pill that meant I was pregnant and told me that the morning after pill doesn't work.

The 21/7 pill is perfectly fine for contraception however, as the placebo pills are mainly to adjust the frequency of withdrawal bleeds.\n\nThings such as nausea could simply be due to the pill itself or plan B, although usually transient and resolves with continued use. Plan B has caveats and proper ways of use although is effective dependent on factors such as timing as it loses most of its effect once ovulation is near or imminent, and becomes ineffective after implantation.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why misinformation was provided to you but that\u2019s unfortunate.

IE, my blood pressure wasn\u2019t staying steady.\n\nSoon enough the doctor I was seeing at the time had me on max dosage on three different blood pressure meds. My hair was starting to loosen, my gums were bleeding, nails were getting pitted. So off to get blood work.\n\nThey then switched out one pill and added two more. On top of my cholesterol meds and type 1 diabetes meds I was at 7 pills a day. The timing on those damn things. Ugh.\n\nAfter more blood work I finally got sent to a nephrologist who read off my list of meds, looked at my barely controlled blood pressure and removed me from all my blood pressure meds and the cholesterol meds. Kept me on the diabetic med tho.\n\nAfter they cleared from my system he had me retested on a very extensive complete blood draw. The list of vials was longer then the tech who drew my blood was tall. Then he added in a different cholesterol med. Boom my cholesterol dropped into just above normal range. Added in a different blood pressure med, wham my blood pressure wasn\u2019t looking like it was on a roller coaster.\n\nAnd then this last blood draw and would you lookie there, things were looking healthy\u2026or rather healthier. I asked about a allergy test to determine if I\u2019m allergic and it was immediately shot down. With how long I was on them he doesn\u2019t want to take the chance I have a sudden bad attack.\n\nSo after all that, I wish you all the health you can stand.

I was probably 2 weeks from total kidney failure. \n\n\nI'm curious if you were ever given a reason as to why the NSAIDS affected you so negatively.\nThank  you for the support, I have started eating less crap foods, cut my sugar/salt intake and lost a few lbs, I always drank water, never soda, but I have upped my intake of H2O from 20oz per day to 90oz. a day.\nWishing you a healthier future.\n\n My next labs are in 2 weeks, and doctors in 3 weeks.

However, I have noticed that if you view the top porn charts on AVN, the top hetero porn is marketed on the basis of aggression and degradation of women, whereas the top gay porn generally just portrays two men having anal sex.\n\nLastly, gay men are the target market of gay porn, whereas straight men are the target market of straight porn. The porn industry is largely men creating videos for men, using mostly women.\n\nYour point, which seems to be that the industry, the abuse within it, and the porn that it creates, is not gendered, is totally incoherent with the facts."

So many people overestimate how many calories they burn. It doesn\u2019t matter if there is vegetables m. If she uses hella butter or oil it\u2019s going to negate vegetables. And not all vegetables are low calorie. If she actually cooked with low calorie vegetables in very healthy way you would be thin as hell. There is no magic to it. Diet is 70%- 80% the reason the person body composition is how it is barring health issues. It is proven that most people undecount their calories and over count how many calories they burn. Literally go calorie count by weighting what you cook and you will see.if you eat out you will likely easily amass massive calories due to the amount of oils and fats and added sugars. I was once a trainer and competitive power lifter. I counted calories and exercise with advanced trackers and timing eating to optimize peak performance. I was once like you thinking why am I so fat.

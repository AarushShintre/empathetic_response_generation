In a 2002 survey conducted for PBS/Frontline by the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University, ***86 percent*** of respondents said porn can educate people, and ***72 percent*** said it provides a ***harmless outlet*** for fantasies. ***Among those who reported using pornography, 80 percent said they felt \"fine\" about it.***\r  \n\r  \n***\"There are a lot of people out there using a lot of porn who have no problems with it whatsoever,\"*** says Erick Janssen, PhD, a senior scientist at the Kinsey Institute. \"So when does it become an addiction?\"  \n\n\nCan't find a single line in this article that states anything about \"Lizard brains\" or \"adaptations to X stimuli\".   \nSo it says exactly what every rational person understands : Abuse of ANYTHING can be bad. Moderation of MOST things is healthy and does NOT cause issues. Did you even read the article?  \n\n\nIt says 9 percent of people surveyed found it difficult to stop. Unfortunately, the article fails to express the amount of people it surveyed so that number is useless for drawing any conclusions.  \n\n\nYOU claim (and I quote) : ***Our bodies have adapted for real situations, and since porn basically provides all of the stimulation without any of the need for development, it essentially fucks up your lizard brain into thinking it has hit the procreational jackpot.***  \n\n\nNone of which is mentioned in this article. I'm open to ready ANY source that backs up your claim that includes any of the points you originally stated. There are many points in the article that state that viewing pornography under certain conditions (i.e Couples watching it together) in fact *increase* sexual satisfaction with said partner. It even goes so far to say that results are *inconclusive* because it faces the chicken and egg paradox. Do partners resort to porn because they feel unhappy in the relationship or are they unhappy *because* they watch porn?  \n\n\nI genuinely don't think you read the article."

It guys who usually have issues with it.\n\nGuys that watched porn felt depressed, with low self esteem and low sex drive. The article mentiones that the porn they watch is usually devoid of context. This is what I'm talking about. The brain gets its satisfaction (seeing sexual acts) without the development of how it got to that situation. Porn is overall, bad (for dudes, I guess)\n\nThink about it this way: porn gives you the benefit of sexual gratification, easily. This, however, isn't how we would do things in nature. To get sexual gratification, one would have to have sex. But to have sex, you would have needed to develop your social and interpersonal skills and have some sort of an elevated position in your local hierarchy. In this way, getting sex is an incentive. With porn, that's gone."

No one has that right.\n\n>you're committing murder \n\nSomeone dying because they were removed from someone's body isn't murder. Do you also call doctors murderers for removing folks from life support?\n\n>And the three most popular world religions all practice circumcision,\n\nAnd most first world countries do not. Many religions also practice female genital mutilation. Is that okay to you too?\n\n>the penis has no need of the extra skin so there's no problem in cutting it off\n\nThere's no need for a clitoris either. But we don't go cutting those off babies. Plus, there are many men that have life long problems from their circumcisions.\n\n>They can put the baby in medically induced sleep so it doesn't feel pain.\n\nBut they normally don't."

Maybe it's annoying to have a dry dick head and to know that you had no decision in how your genitals look? Either way, it being annoying doesn't validate infant mutilation. My husband is circumcised, so I guess not.

You're a complete idiot, I can tell. You lack the comprehension to understand even what I was saying to begin with, so now you've created this new fictitious argument? \n\nWhat a weirdo. Have a great day. \n\nAlso, PS... nobody (at least in this thread) is hating on whiteness. You are not oppressed homie, even in this reddit thread, stop trying to create a situation where you want to be a victim. The fact that you said \"I have respect for Malcolm x\" then turn around and said \"why do you hate whites *these days*\" explains all I need yo know about your lack of awareness and the depth of your knowledge regarding *actual\" civil rights"

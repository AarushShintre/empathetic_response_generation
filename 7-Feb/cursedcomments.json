It would likely not seem unreasonable to fight back using violence. Therefor the argument \u201cit\u2019s two sided\u201d is silly when one has a gun and the other a stick. The notions that Israel does not have total control is insane, it has the 3d most powerful military in THE WORLD. Unfortunately main stream media is quick to point out a stabbing commuted by a Palestinian, but fails to present the ongoing struggle of a nation and its ppl under occupation. It\u2019s a terrible desperate situation. Do not be fooled it is religious at hard, it\u2019s political to the very end, and the west is happy to comply with a military power at its disposal in the Middle East, even at the cost of ongoing instability in the entire region."

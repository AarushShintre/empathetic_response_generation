We use infrastructure very differently, quite individually I would say, even within the same city, let alone differences between urban and rural folk.\n\nBut the economy requires all of these materials and is in theory for the benefit of everyone. So you can't say that the buildings in NYC have no impact on your life if you lived in rural Montana (say).\n\nI find this interesting because the numbers are staggering both on the field side and minerals side. On the materials side this is just the materials needed for new things, let alone those that have been used to build everything we have already.\n\nMy takeaway is that we use loads of resources even if it doesn't seem like it because we don't think of the roads, shops, distributions centers, farms, car/truck manufacturers and all the water, elec and fuel infrastructure that's needed to keep it all going."

Can you click on the link that was provided for you twice and read the first paragraph?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ll provide the first paragraph for you because you don\u2019t seem to be able to click on links. \n\n\u201cDemocrats have been fighting to secure universal health care for the American people for generations, and we are proud to be the party that passed Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n \nDEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM\n\nHonestly dude you either don\u2019t have great reading comprehension or you\u2019re just skimming through my replies and ignoring the links.

If I am confused, I guarantee that the layperson will be even more so.\n\n>red = Rep states in 2020 election\n\nblue = Dem states in 2020 election\n\nEven here, you aren't being clear enough. Are they \"republican\" because their votes for president in the 2020 election were majority in favor of the Republican candidate? Republican because they elected more Republican House congresspeople / senators? I can infer that you're likely referring to the electoral college result, but when people have to infer what you mean with your data, that's just bad practice that is bound to get you in trouble in the future.\n\n>t-tests are usually reported using the p-value\n\nNot always, no. A lot of published research will tell you both the t-statistic AND the p-value. If you're giving us a p-value, you should say it's a p-value, end of story.\n\n>the t-test is sensitive to small mean variations: the top right plot shows the means separated by a SD, which is NOT a small difference ( t-test = 0.000015).\n\nThat's great, but why didn't you state that result in the graph? And again, don't say \"t-test equals\", at least say \"t-test p-value equals\". It's nonsense to say that a test equals something. The test generates a statistic and a p-value which equal something, but the test itself is a test. It pays to be explicit with what you are saying, or else other statisticians could misinterpret what you are saying. In this case, if someone thought you meant the t-statistic was 0.000015, that would mean the results were highly non-significant and would think you screwed up your calculation.\n\nYou seem to have some idea in your mind of how things are \"typically\" interpreted by various groups of people, but you should NOT rely on those assumptions because inevitably someone will interpret gray area in a way you didn't intend. It is always far, far preferable to be as explicit as you can with your definitions of things.\n\nAgain I think showing this as a sorted scatterplot is just weird. You really ought to show this data as a histogram. You're using a t-test, yeah? So it's really incumbent on you to demonstrate that the data really does follow the shape of a t-distribution to prove to your audience that such a test is acceptable. A histogram achieves that; this scatterplot does not.\n\nFinally, maybe it's just me, but grouping these things together on a state level just feels like you're losing so much detail and misclassifying so much data that I really question the validity of your results. Maybe this is the best you have to work with, but you are classifying a state that went 51% in favor of the Democrat as 100% Democratic and vice versa, which then classifies every single school district in that state, including the likely numerous rural school districts where people are more likely to be conservative, as \"Democratic\" school districts contributing however much money they contributed towards education. You'd get a lot more robust data and far less of this kind of error if you were able to get this data by school district. If you don't have that data, it is what it is, but the end result is that I'll consider everything I said here and think \"eh, this is kinda just bad analysis and is meaningless\" and it gets disregarded. And I imagine you wouldn't want the analysis you spent all of this time and effort on to be disregarded, yeah?"

      "body": "Thanks for this differentiated response. I am thinking that what actually divides us is that we don't listen to others and the we see the \"otherness\" instead of the commonalities. Put white people into a bad neighborhood without fathers and you get the same problems as with other ethnicities. It seems that not the ethnicity is/has a problem, but that people are in bad places and that it's mostly minority ethnicities that are in bad places. For instance, if you are ethnic Russian in Eastern Estonia, you'll have a worse chance in this society than \"pure\" Estonians. So I am then wondering why it's race that is used to explain differences? And why is it that when social scientist speak about diversity, they don't abide by the statistical standards that exist, eg, in the actual diversity science (ecology). These shitty figures just plant weird ideas into the mind of anybody that doesn't fully understand ALL of those issues, and that's most people... Idk, I am simply not convinced it's a good solution to constantly tell people about their differences."

Similarly, they are born with the innate ability to count and discern quantities, but how they develop those abilities depends on their environment and learning experiences. Abilities are developed in supportive environments.\n\nALSO science and engineering are very different fields. The relationship between male and female scientists is way more balanced than that of m:f engineers. You\u2019re trying to make the woke point that women and men have exactly the same aptitudes and this is simply false. OFC there are women who have aptitudes usually found in males but that\u2019s not the usual case. There\u2019s so many biological and societal factors that makes us different from another."

They raised him, they are pretty much the entire thing that created him. Also society, of course. No, they are not, they did what they had to (provide food, shelter and some upbringing), the consequences are for the society to handle. What if one of them also provided an offensive weapon or joined the crime? This one is responsible. What if one of them was forced to commit a crime at gunpoint? No, it's called being held hostage. What if while being held hostage one did not use a possibility to escape or arrest the criminal? Still no.\n\nPutin and the governmental apparatus are an adult child criminal, Russians are parents. Those fighting on his side, or providing support towards illegal actions are the  responsible, helping parent. Oppressed once are victims. There are immigrants/refugees - escaped victims. There's society - the whole world.

I used to live in the states and there isn\u2019t that much difference in the food we eat that you seem to think. \n\nWe don\u2019t survive on eating grass and seaweeds. Our diet has been heavily westernized and we eat burgers, cakes and drink soda. \n\nOne big difference is that I walk several miles almost every day by necessity here while when I was in the I had to drive almost everywhere I went."

And I think your underestimating how much different our diets really are. \n\nAnd I never said you are just eating seaweed and grass. But your average diet of an American is vastly different than most places. We eat way more processed food than most places do.\n\nEurope is westernized obviously and heavily urbanized. They are dealing with a rapidly rising obesity rate as well. China is dealing with the same issue as they develop more.\n\nAnd just cause you lived her a little bit doesn't suddenly give you some great insight into the nation. That be the same as me living in Japan for a few years and saying I suddenly understand everything Japanese."

If someone is making and selling counterfeits of something - then that harms multiple parties - in this context, often including shareholders, customers, the company itself, and employees. \n\nThe problem isn't a one off thing - it's a common practice in the [Mitt Romney-esque Bain Capital](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/on-mitt-romney-bain-capital-and-private-equity-190349/) firms of the world. You can read more about the specifics in [this](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/cellar-boxing-the-predatory-secret-that-wall-street-uses-to-exploit-an-infinite-money-glitch-in-97ccbd6c9923).\n\nAs well, there are serious tax implications related to the whole thing for both individual investors and states. You can read more here (I tried to get the pages oriented in easy to read format, but when uploading they reverted; I tried to fix it a couple ways, but it wouldn't; nonetheless you can turn your head or save them to your comp and then do it yourself): [page 1](https://ibb.co/Z1MXH6d), [page 2](https://ibb.co/j6Z4KTY), [page 3](https://ibb.co/3p65xwL), [page 4](https://ibb.co/F5GrXRs), [page 5](https://ibb.co/rMVwfMB). As can be seen there, individual investors are paying far more in taxes than they should be - while states are getting far less (to the tune of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions) every single year than they should be. The problem has only gotten worse in the past decade, so those estimates/numbers are now low.\n\nWhen companies and individual investors fall into the sights of the larger hedge funds and banks, etc... it must be remembered that we're talking about people's livelihoods, families enjoying income and fruits of labor, standards of living maintained, pensions, retirements, and more. When we're talking about mechanisms and reasons for wealth inequality and the problems that arise and come from that, these are some of those *major, key* mechanisms."

It's well-known that many an election has come down to 1% of the vote - both politically and corporate-ly. Life and death, literally *and* figuratively *and* business-ly *and* socially and psychologically, hangs in that balance very often. \n\n\nFurthermore, the votes associated with phantom shares and overvoting (via lending, shorting, and FTDs) have been found to be commonly *far more* than 1%. Again, out of 341 elections studied, *all* 341 found to have more votes than there should have been (see previous source [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20060421085925/http://www.rgm.com/articles/FalseProxies.pdf)).

(If someone comes away with that then it needs to be re-read andor read the link below this paragraph as a clarification and suuplement.) The fact of the matter is you and your family and myself and family and a vast majority of people pay more in taxes than they should - while those responsible pay *less.* Furthermore, as already stated, individual states and associated citizens are losing due revenue year after year after year. See [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1016873) for primary research on the subject.

Using publicly available data on FTDs in NYSE and NASDAQ \"threshold securities\" **alone,** I calculate that loss to have been $762 million in 2007. *This is not a one-time loss, but an ongoing monetary loss to investors that will not diminish as long as the system tolerates FTDs.* \n\n(my emphasis; see [here](https://ibb.co/rMVwfMB) for source; \"page 5\") \n\n>Can you give me examples of people who have been harmed by these votes, and the events which caused the harm?\n\nThe examples have already been given in the form of the links throughout the previous comments.

There's a lot to sift through; not all is accurate, but a lot is. As well, reading *Naked, Short, and Greedy* by S. Trimbath will give numerous examples (as an aside, if AftyoftheUK is reading (naughty chap, isn't he?

In it a numerous credible people including Robert Shapiro of Georgetown University (He holds a Ph.D. from Harvard University, a M.Sc. from the London School of Economics and Political Science, and an A.B. from the University of Chicago. He also has been a Fellow of the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Brookings Institution, and Harvard University.) and Wes Christian, a longtime \"whistleblower\" and attorney - both of which spoke relatively highly of the documentary. The movie The Big Short and Inside Job are also worth a watch which give some context and history. See [here](https://jewishbusinessnews.com/2021/04/19/top-5-documentaries-about-the-2008-subprime-mortgage-debacle/) for more documentaries on the broader housing and derivative subject).   \n\nTo end: it should be noted that FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) and the NYSE are Self-Regulatory Organizations (SROs) - *\"We investigated ourselves and found no wrongdoing!.* More importantly, though, the DTCC/Cede & Co. is also an SRO and it is *impossible* (for \"regular people\" - for non-executives of the DTCC) to tell the extent to which FTDs are laced throughout the system because they do not provide that information. This wouldn't be a problem if  they just came clean - which can be done in a safe and privacy-oriented way by publishing related raw numbers that can then be cross-referenced with public information and data."

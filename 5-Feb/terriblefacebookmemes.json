That's all I want to know, cause it seems like no matter what I say you accuse me of knowing what I was doing all along, and that I'm being manipulative. I'm not, I am debating with you. Honestly, it's more of an argument at this point because for some reason you made it personal when we were talking about being neurodivergent. \n\nLet's break your comment down piece by piece. One: The reason I said you \"hate me\" is you've made it weirdly personal, started armchair diagnosing/accusing me of my entire self being manipulative, and even if you genuinely think that, you could've said it in more a \"hey this isn't a constructive way to form an argument\" instead you keep saying the way I talk sounds manipulative, whatever that means. \n\nTwo: I don't go around saying that I'm nice to everyone, your reading comprehension is poor, because I said that I wasn't one of those people are effortlessly nice and really genuine to people. I have NEVER said I'm nice to anyone in my life, I'm hate talking to new people, and can't carry a conversation to save my life, so it's not like I'm evangelising my own life story or whatever the fuck you think I do. \n\nThree: I'm not pretending to be a victim. I'm ARGUING. I'm telling you my point of view, and if my point of view gets emotional at times, it's literally just a writing tactic. Have you not heard of \"emotional language\"?

Also, like a true republic their government could pass regulations to ensure they\u2019re paid better wages.

The \u201cillegal mines\u201d are allowed to operate because China allows them to so that they can claim they don\u2019t operate unethical mines. Are you as stupid as you act or are you just playing propagandist. Nobody in the Congo mines cobalt unless the government allows it these people would be killed for mining one Chinese land if not for China allowing them to mine it ASM\u2019s are just a proxy for China 15 of the 19 mines in the Congo are operated on Chinese mining territory the other 4 are a European conglomerate which is just as corrupt. Just because you don\u2019t understand the game the CCP plays in order to deflect the blame from them doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not occurring. You\u2019re just too damn dense to grasp the concept"

It's a hard choice deciding whether or not to fight back and use a firearm in a robbery. There are so many ways it could go wrong.\n\nI appreciate you keeping this discussion chill, some people just get really emotional and aggressive when it comes to topics like this."

      "body": "I recognize that when I chose to carry a firearm or keep one in the house, it is a huge responsibility. I understand that I am personally liable to every round I fire and you cant take those rounds back. I say that to say I don't take having the means to take a life lightly. I don't want to shoot anyone, just like I don't want my life or the lives of my family members to be threatened.\n\nI decided a few years ago when I went down this path that it is a different way of living, I find myself avoiding areas where I am more likely to be in sketchy situations because I am so much more aware when I have a gun on me. Some might argue that that is already a win and that just having a higher situational awareness lowers our risk of being victimized by a lot.\n\nBecause I understand the risks and the liability, I train with my firearm. I don't just go to the range and shoot for fun. I used to stand directly in front of a paper target and practice drawing in close quarters so I don't shoot myself in the heat of the moment. Training can only get you so far. There is no way to simulate the stress and adrenaline the you will encounter if it actually happens but it's better than nothing.\n\nPersonally, I chose to not be a defenseless victim. I choose to take responsibility for my own protection and safety. I am okay with the possibility of having my day in court if I ever need to defend myself because I would never draw my gun to take a life unless I felt like my own life was in danger (family as well). I will concede to you that my way is not the perfect solution but we live in an imperfect world where we unfortunately have people that hurt and kill people daily. I think that is what we should really be up in arms over together. We should be marching in the streets shoulder to shoulder to protest the criminals who would do harm to innocent people."

But people have decided to align their identity with them.\n\n[A 2019 DiMaggio et al. study looked at mass shooting data for 1981 to 2017found that mass-shooting fatalities were 70% less likely to occur during the 1994 to 2004 federal ban period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban#Effects)\n\nI hear what you're saying, and I'm not oblivious to the dangers that we face in our society today, but there's a wall that's been erected, and it doesn't allow for any discussion about firearms, and the fearmongering states that any discussion will result in legislation that will repeal the use of ALL firearms, which just isn't going to happen.\n\nThanks again for being chill."

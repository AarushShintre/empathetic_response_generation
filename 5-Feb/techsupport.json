Since you are on cable, it will be much less. You could be congesting the uplink. All communication with the Internet requires some uplink bandwidth, even if most of the data flow is in the downlink direction.\n\nYou may also want to check the logs in the modem and/or router.

      "body": "If that speed test is accurate, then you could very well be congesting your downlink. Cable Internet is a shared medium, meaning that you share bandwidth with other, nearby neighbors. If there are a lot of neighbors, then there may be not be enough bandwidth for everyone to use their Internet connection at their max subscribed bandwidth. This is due to a practice called [oversubscription](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overselling). It\u2019s similar to an airline selling more seats than are available on a plane. \n\nYour max speeds could also be limited by other factors. Your modem could have a weak connection to the ISP. There are guides for interpreting the signal levels available on the modem\u2019s status page. As I mentioned before, you should log into the modem and look at the logs. \n\nYou could try calling your ISP. You could say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m not getting the 300 Mbps I paid for.\u201d Set your expectations low. Many ISPs will tell you something along the lines of, \u201cWe only provide **up to 300 Mbps**\u201d.\n\nIt might be interesting to know whether your devices can still ping each other when the problem is happening. This would help determine if the Internet connection is the problem or the router itself.\n\nIf you do determine that you are simply using up all of the bandwidth that your Internet connection is capable of, you can try turning QoS on the router. QoS can help manage bandwidth usage by devices. How well QoS works depends on the router. Some routers have poor QoS implementations and can actually make things worse. There\u2019s no harm in trying it. You can always turn it off if it doesn\u2019t help. \n\nIn Steam, you can limit the bandwidth used for downloads. You might want to set it something like 150 Mbps. This should leave at least 50 Mbps for everything else."

This is probably a long shot, but you might be able to test the GPU by installing it without any power cables.  The motherboard power alone might be enough to cause a potential GPU issue to show up again and turn your computer off.  If that does end up happening, then it's the GPU.

And once your Microsoft account is cracked, you really don\u2019t have an easy way back into your physical computer other than a wipe-and-reinstall.\n\nHonestly, use only a local account with a decent password.

If your Microsoft account is ever compromised and your password changed, you are suddenly locked out of your own computer. It gets even worse if you have Bitlocker enabled, as your stuff is then encrypted and impossible to just yoink off the drive.\n\nWhich is why you always want to be able to create a local account on system setup.

Random minimzes to desktop has never been a thing or an issue unless I purposely alt tab.\n\nA week ago a message pops up saying I can upgrade to win 11 so I do. Ever since my games will randomly minimize to desktop. Evidently there's a setting or 'feature' or something windows 11 is doing to take me to desktop repeatedly without me comitting an action. I ignored it the first 10 times because think maybe weird bug, maybe I accidently caught windows key etc etc. However after a week of it evidently something else is happening.

This will reset the CMOS to its default settings, which may help resolve the issue you're experiencing.\r  \n\r  \nThe exact location of the CMOS battery can vary depending on the motherboard model, but it's usually a small coin-shaped battery located near the CMOS chip or the battery socket on the motherboard. You can refer to the motherboard manual or look up the motherboard model online to find its specific location."

      "body": ">I assume I do that with the pc unplugged?\n\nYes, you should turn off the PC, unplug it from the power source, and remove the battery when resetting the CMOS. This is to prevent any electrical interference or damage to the components. After you have removed the battery, wait for 10-15 seconds, and then re-insert it and plug the PC back in. Then start the PC to see if the issue has been resolved."

Thank you soooo much!"

Thank you soooo much!\n\nYou're welcome! I'm glad to hear that the CMOS battery worked. If you are still having trouble accessing the BIOS, try searching for the specific model of your ThinkStation tower or the motherboard and see if there are any key combinations or instructions to access the BIOS. Good luck with your job search!"

      "body": "Here are some steps that you can try to minimize the impact of other devices on your gaming experience:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Prioritize your gaming traffic: You can use Quality of Service (QoS) settings on your router to give higher priority to your gaming traffic, which can reduce lag spikes.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Separate gaming and other traffic: You can use a separate network for gaming and connect your gaming PC to it using a wired connection, which can prevent interference from other devices on the same network.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Upgrade to a better router: If your router does not have QoS features, you can consider upgrading to a better router that supports QoS and has better network management capabilities.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Use a gaming VPN: A gaming VPN can help you reduce lag by routing your traffic through a server that is closer to the gaming servers, which can lower your ping.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Monitor network usage: You can use a network monitoring tool to track your bandwidth usage and identify which devices or applications are consuming the most bandwidth.\r  \n\r  \nThese are some steps you can try to improve your gaming experience while other devices are also using the internet. It may also be helpful to reach out to your ISP to see if they have any suggestions or solutions."

      "body": "Thanks for your reply!\n\nCan you explain a bit how QOS works in relation to this problem? Will it prevent other devices from using the entire bandwidth? Is there any router that you recommend?\n\nI've been thinking of getting the deco x60 (for wireless devices + my PC that will be connected with a cable to one of the nodes). [Seems like QOS is available for it.](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/1601/) Do you know if the x60 QOS is any decent?\n\nRegarding the other suggestions. I assume that the VPN doesn't directly has to do with the issue? is that right?\nUsing a separate connection is too expensive for me sadly.\n\nDo you have any recommendation for network monitoring apps?\n\nAlso, I would like to make sure I understood. You're saying that other devices basically momentarily use the entire bandwidth, which is enough to reflect in the ping spikes?"

      "body": "Yes, that's correct. When other devices on the same network consume bandwidth, it can cause lag spikes in your gaming experience.\r  \n\r  \nQuality of Service (QoS) allows you to set priorities for different types of network traffic, so that critical applications, such as gaming, receive the necessary bandwidth to function properly. This can help reduce lag spikes caused by other devices on the network.\r  \n\r  \nThe TP-Link Deco X60 does have QoS features and is a good option for your situation. However, I would recommend checking the reviews and specifications of different routers before making a decision, to make sure it meets your needs and supports the features you require.\r  \n\r  \nRegarding VPNs, they can help reduce lag by routing your gaming traffic through a server that is closer to the gaming servers, which can lower your ping. However, they won't directly solve the issue of other devices consuming bandwidth and causing lag spikes on your network.\r  \n\r  \nFor network monitoring, you can use tools such as GlassWire, NetSpeedMonitor, or Wireshark. These tools can provide you with information on which devices or applications are consuming the most bandwidth, allowing you to identify potential sources of interference.\r  \n\r  \nIn summary, QoS can help prevent other devices from consuming bandwidth that is necessary for your gaming traffic, reducing lag spikes. I recommend checking the specifications and reviews of different routers before choosing one, and using a network monitoring tool to monitor your network usage."

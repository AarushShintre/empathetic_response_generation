This has two issues:  Education, as indicated by reading proficiency rates, hasn't actually improved since the 1970s [source](https://www.winginstitute.org/have-reading-scores-improved865).  In other words the poor have the same issue with aquiring adequate education as they always have.  The other issue is, we're stretching what that purchasing power can tell us.  For example, comparing apples to apples, it wouldn't indicate 85% of Americans are carrying a device in their pocket with (literally) millions of times more computing power than the best computers ever built at the time.  In summary, the poor are just as poor since they're not able to participate in the economy any better than before, while the richer are continuing to reap the huge economic improvements from the investments made in STEM."

The average private school tuition is only about $12k.   \n    \nedit: so just allow parents the option to use that money towards private school as a voucher."

Not like our great country\" it comes back to my original point, the world only has the free trade it does because of America's Navy. The world only has a fraction of peace and stability cause of America. And while America changes rapidly and we seem to gain ever worse people into politics the identity of America and its strength is the diversity of its people.

Every candidate in history has supporters who leave them or come to them in a reelection. This happened to Trump and it will happen to Biden. \n\nThere are always leakers at every level of government. It is virtually impossible for a group of people to keep a secret. The most secure information is worked on by different groups of people who literally know what they alone are working on. They are not privy to other subjects. So there isn\u2019t this one person who knows everything. Security clearance is given when needed and removed when needed. Again I go back to keeping a secret. Somebody, somewhere is going to say something to someone that\u2019s going to hear it and repeat it. It\u2019s human nature. \n\nThe Deep State is scared of Trump so they have to steal the election. Wouldn\u2019t it just be easier to use their vast knowledge to \u201chelp\u201d him die quietly in his sleep. An accident, a crazed supporter or opponent mentally ill enough to do it or believe that they in fact did do it. Plenty of these people show up at police stations confessing to every crime imaginable. These complicated plans where they use Italian satellites and Venezuelan voting software and mules to deposit large numbers of ballots has too many points of potential failure. One thing goes wrong and everyone will find out about it. If I was a deep state operative I\u2019d pick the easiest least obtrusive manner to get rid of a problem, one that wouldn\u2019t bring attention to me. But that\u2019s just me. \n\nLiterally the entire world\u2019s medical community, news media and other interested parties observed the implementation, roll out and use of the Covid vaccine. It again is simply unbelievable to me that every anti- American group or government turned a blind eye to their citizens or friends dying from a vaccine and kept it a secret to protect a foreign government\u2019s drug industry from paying the price for killing its citizens. Law suits would fly so fast your head would spin. Billions and billions of dollars to be made in court. I also don\u2019t see that happening. \n\nFor me when I consider some of the rumors and conspiracies some sound plausible or at least possible on the surface, until you consider the logistics of pulling of the conspiracy and covering it up. \n\nI\u2019m a child of the 70\u2019s and I love a good Bigfoot story. Always have always will. But there is no Bigfoot. Yes, an individual Bigfoot can always hide, just be on the other side of the hill, etc. That\u2019s true, but Bigfoot doesn\u2019t live in isolation, he has relatives and from a biological state there needs to be 5000 breeding pairs to support a Bigfoot population and keep it from going extinct. I can believe I can\u2019t find one Bigfoot but I can\u2019t find evidence of 5000? I don\u2019t think so."

Intersex people who are both male and female or neither male or female (depending on your perspective) exist. The biological sex of a person is generally determined by sex-linked chromosomes but people can be born with 3 X chromosomes or 2 Y chromosomes. The vast majority of people (trans people included) fall under the male or female sex.\n\nOn the other hand, gender is how someone's personal expression lines up with socially-crafted gender norms. In our society we apply arbitrary characteristics and preferences to particular genders and when people don't have see themselves as falling into those gendered norms, they sometimes choose to express themselves in ways that conform to different genders. So when you ask \"what is a woman?\" I can easily say that it's someone who conforms to traditionally female gender norms, regardless of their biological sex."

Why is one good while the other is abysmal? \n\nI think there are a few factors. \n\n1. The reason why I only (_somewhat_) agree with your sentiments about leniency with regards to intent and history of fuckups. Military hospitals are staffed and ran by Military personnel who play by military rules. VA hospitals and their employees are paid out of the bottomless pocket of uncle Sam, but are staffed by \"federal employees\" - technically not \"civilians\" but... yeah, civilians. Finances and level of care managed by people with an \"8 strikes you're out\" mentality. \n\n2. These \"federal employees\" are operating under a quasi-\"corporate\" mentality that is unburdened by any notion of \"the customer is always right\" or \"customer satisfaction is our goal\" or anything of the sort. They get paid the same whether their patients are pleased, healthy, dead, whatever. There is no supply and demand, no competition; nothing that governs the free market applies to them. They play by the same rules as the assholes behind the counter at the DMV. They have no incentive to be excellent. None of that free market incentive exists in the military either, hence why military spending (AKA wanton subsidizing of the military-industrial complex) accounts for so much of the national \"budget,\" but excellence is demanded in the military and those demands are enforced with sufficient regularity that nobody has any illusion of having a \"get out of jail free card\" in their pocket, even for a first offense or an honest mistake.\n\n3. There are throngs of able-bodied veterans making laughable claims which get approved because more dependents means more funding. Guy comes back from a 5 mile run through the mountains and gets in a car with \"disabled veteran\" plates; later at a bar he will brag to someone about how his 20% for sleep apnea, 10% for shingles, 40% for shin splints, 15% for generalized anxiety and 15% for vertigo add up to 100%. I can't tell you how many worthless fucks I know who do this. Freeloaders. Looters. And, also they veterans, so who can call them out? _ME_.\n\n4. It is my understanding that a lot of VA care is farmed out to private entities with government contracts. This is the worst kind of crap. Worst of both/all worlds. These are civilian DMV assholes who get to name their own price. Like the fuckers who work for the Toll Road company or the electric utility company. They have you under their thumb, you are _forced_ to deal with them, they know that, and they act accordingly. They seem to actually take pleasure in treating people like shit. I can't _imagine_ seeking medical care from people like this. Disgusting. \n\nIMO, 100% free market industry or 100% government-ran is the way to go. Anything in the middle, any kind of combination or amalgamation of the two is an assured disaster. My personal preference for almost everything is 100% free market, but there are certain industries where the equations governing the free market are unbalanced by infinite demand, resulting in ballooning prices for diminishing returns (like Healthcare, insurance, etc.). Any attempt to control things to a reasonable level by imposing regulation on these industries just makes things worse. Every time. Every time the government gets involved, they screw things up. That (existing regulations) is part of the problems we have today but the root of it is the infinite demand. People's lives are literally at stake and they'll pay any amount the bank will lend them.\n\nIMO the VA should be siezed by the military, flushed of shitbags, and ran the way the military runs things. The existing spending of the top brass should be audited, military spending cut by half (we could do that without losing a single iota of military readiness) and that money used to start a public Healthcare system patterned after the military's Healthcare system (_NOT_ patterned after the existing VA). 100% government-ran. No monkeys in the middle. Think of it like the public school system. No, It's not the best; you can get a better education for your kids by paying for private school, but it's there for everyone who needs it, and it's not some abortion of a private industry funded by infinite government funds."

Maybe she is getting tired of hearing how all her gfs are having wild sex with their friends together and you resent me so much cause there\u2019s no way you two will ever be able to do that cause let\u2019s face it, your no catch and your probably dating out of our league in the first place or she\u2019s no catch either so y\u2019all can only get the ugly DND types, not the cool ones, but the ones picked last in dodgeball types. \n\nSo you hold on for dear life to your Christianity and marriage license cause you think that paper will keep you together as your waistline expands & looks fade before her very eyes? \n\nCause I feel like you project a little hard when you said you hate my lifestyle.  \n\nLike your so uncomfortable that my girls might have another partner, cause that confidence of knowing they can fuck whoever and will never find a better time then when they are with me has got to eat at your fragile relationship and inability to make her cum 40+ times in a session. I mean sometimes I just use a piece of rope to make women cum. And here you are struggling to get her cum period. \n\nYou know how many women I have taught how to cum for the first time? It\u2019s over 2 dozen and many were in their 40s and stuck in marriages with guys who don\u2019t know shit. It\u2019s sad. \n\nGuys like me threaten only those who are shitty in bed cause their girl might get a chance to learn what sex is supposed to be, actually pleasurable without shame. And they will forever recall those inept lovers as the worst fuck they ever had."

When writing a one minute comment I don't think of the multitude of ways it can be interpreted. \nI would've said pretty much the same if it was an internal transfer. \nSaying someone else can have her/him/that is a throw away line, seen many times and in this instance was used by me. \nThis woman has been given a gift of an incredible talent but missed out on humility. I'm not a fan of or hold in high esteem beautiful/talented people who have no sense of respect for others. Maybe she has underlying issues.\nAnd I def missed the sarcasm. Maybe too tightly wound at the mo."

Yes it is good to see a different perspective and get some good information because I didn't know who that girl was much less her her character..and I definitely don't hang with the racism. \n\nI am American but half Hispanic (Mexican/Spanish) and the rest is English/Irish/Scottish but brought up by my dad who is Hispanic so being caught in between both worlds I got a lot of racial comments thrown my way, so I definitely jump the gun when I think something sounds racial.

He sold more than 4 million albums in the United States, as of 2013,[1] and more than 10 million records worldwide.[2][3] Aaron Carter released **his debut single \"Crush on You\" in 1997, which was a Top 10 in Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom.** His self-titled debut album was released in the same year in Europe, and sold more than 1 million copies worldwide.[4] **In 2000 Aaron signed with Jive Records and released three more studio albums; the first of them, Aaron's Party (Come Get It), was his most successful album, and sold more than three million copies in United States alone, being certified 3\u00d7 Platinum by RIAA.** Carter released the EP Love in 2017 after fourteen years since his last album with new material; he followed this in 2018 with the full-length album of the same name.\n\n  \nComparing him to a cover band is just disingenuous."

But there is a decent amount of caselaw that shows even though a defendant may believe the firearm is unloaded, they can still be found to have acted recklessly. Courts have also found that a refusal to undergo training for firearms can be a factor in raising the standard from negligence to recklessness.

I find it hard to believe that the 30-minute lesson didn't say something along the lines that \"people have been repeating ad nauseum\".

And they made sure that I left him,\u201d Lisa told me, perhaps sensing that I, like so many others, had assumed her 1994 marriage to pop superstar Michael Jackson was some sort of put-on.\n\nShe said that her affection for him was very real, but that Scientology had its own interests in the union: It had long wanted to bring in Jackson, who had a Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses background. \u201cBut then they realized he was getting too much bad press,\u201d she said.\nShe denied ever seeing anything like what Jackson was accused of that would result, ten years later, in a trial for child molestation.\n\n\u201cFucking around little boys? Dude, do you think I\u2019d be with someone if I witnessed that?\u201d she said.\nIn a 2003 Rolling Stone interview, Lisa described some of the things that were driving a wedge into the marriage. That, for example, she hadn\u2019t seen Michael in a month as he prepared for the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards, and there was also the time Jackson had said something false to a TV Guide interviewer, claiming that Lisa had told him that Elvis had gotten a nose job.\n\nWhen Rolling Stone asked her how things had come to a head, she replied \u201cI\u2019d had enough. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nTo me, however, she said that Scientology was intimately involved in the split.\n\u201cI was in love with Michael. I wanted to help him,\u201d she said. But there was always a Scientology presence wherever they went. \u201cThere was always someone here. Even when we did that ABC prime time interview, there was always a Scientology handler right there.\u201d\n\nIn particular, two figures were involved in driving them apart, she said.\n\u201cDM [David Miscavige] facilitated my divorce with MJ,\u201d she said, claiming that Miscavige and a Scientologist attorney, John P. Coale, pressured her to file for divorce.\n\n\u201cI was calling Dave, asking, what do I do? He was a huge MJ fan. He was all over that,\u201d she said. She was told to make sure that Jackson didn\u2019t file for divorce first, because it would give him an advantage in court.\n\u201cOne morning I got a call from John Coale. He said, \u2018Michael\u2019s going to make a move. He\u2019s going to file.\u2019 So I filed.\u201d\n\nShe explained that she felt pressured to be the first to file for divorce, but then regretted it.\nJohn P. Coale is not only a well known Scientologist attorney, he made a name for himself suing tobacco companies in the 1980s, and has also made news as a political operator. He\u2019s married to TV journalist Greta Van Susteren, who joined the church as a result of marrying him in 1988.\n\n(Lisa mentioned that she thought it was unusual that a TV journalist would be a Scientologist, when founder L. Ron Hubbard had such disdain for the media. But she said that Miscavige told her that Van Susteren \u201chelped Scientology with Fox News.\u201d Van Susteren left Fox News the year after my conversation with Lisa, and she has historically been very tight-lipped about her Scientology involvement.)\nI spoke with Coale this past Friday, after letting him know what Lisa had told me. He had a different version of events.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I never told her to love or unlove Mr. Jackson. This is 30 years ago,\u201d he said.\nAnd he added it was \u201cabsurd\u201d that he would have told Lisa to file for divorce before Jackson. The reason?\n\u201cThere was no contest.\u201d\n\nCoale said he vividly remembered a lunch he had with Johnnie Cochran, who represented Jackson.\n\u201cWhat do you want to do? I asked him. They don\u2019t have any children. They each have their own money. There\u2019s no joint property. There was nothing to fight over. So that was it and we ate lunch. There was never any contest,\u201d Coale said. \u201cIt was a great lunch. Johnnie Cochran was a really great guy. It\u2019s a shame he died. He was a great lawyer and great guy. And that\u2019s what he would do. There was nothing to fight about.\u201d\n\nCoale suggested that Lisa might have confused him for another lawyer handling the case. \u201cThat was what I did with Cochran. She had other lawyers who wrote up the papers. I don\u2019t know what happened there,\u201d he said. \u201cI never advised her about what to do with the relationship with Michael Jackson. I don\u2019t know if anyone else did.\u201d\n\nAs for Miscavige, Coale said he never talked to the church leader about the Presley-Jackson matter at the time.\n\u201cI\u2019ve known him for years, but I\u2019ve probably talked to him under ten times,\u201d Coale said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably been six or seven years since I saw him.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, nineteen years after her divorce, Lisa told me she believed that Miscavige was behind the effort to drive her away from Jackson, and she likened it to what she had read that Miscavige had done in Tom Cruise\u2019s marriages.\n\n\u201cI know how in love they were,\u201d she said, referring to Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who split in 2000. \u201cBut they were driven apart.\u201d\n\nScientology\u2019s reputation for indoctrination and control was pretty legendary, and celebrities have come forward to detail it in the past. But I wondered about her family\u2019s involvement in Scientology\u2019s \u201ctechnology,\u201d the arcane past-life therapy that it sold at considerable prices.\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s not Clear. She takes courses and reads books, but she\u2019s not involved,\u201d she said, suggesting that Priscilla had not applied herself to making it to the higher steps on what Scientology calls its \u201cBridge to Total Freedom.\u201d\nLisa herself had gone nearly to the top of the Bridge, reaching OT 7.\n\n\u201cOperating Thetan Level Seven\u201d is the second highest \u201cauditing level,\u201d and the most grueling, requiring years for some to finish it.\n\u201cI never finished it. I quit after three months,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was bullshit. It was just about control. It was just a way of getting more money.\u201d\nAnd the other celebrities she\u2019d met in Scientology? I was curious what kind of relationship she had with them.\n\nTom Cruise?\n\u201cI fucking hate Tom. I met him 20 years ago. I said I never want to be in a room with him again.\u201d\n\nJohn Travolta?\n\n\u201cJohn is my last Scientology friend. Kelly [Preston] kind of monitors us.

I asked what Lisa meant by \u201cunruly,\u201d and she described late nights with Travolta talking about what the rest of the world thought about Scientology, which the church considers a forbidden exercise.\n\u201cI told him about the HBO thing. He had no idea. I told him that Debbie Cook was gone. He had no idea. He has no Internet or email. He\u2019s so sheltered. All he knows is what they tell him. He\u2019s smart but sheltered.\u201d"

      "body": "Part 3:\nShelly Miscavige?\n\n\u201cShe was a force to be reckoned with. I don\u2019t know what exactly went down. I do feel that she really cared about him [Dave]. But I think she stepped on his feet.\u201d\nThe wife of Scientology leader David Miscavige, Shelly vanished from the international management base near Hemet in 2005, and was seen at the funeral of her father in the summer of 2007, and not since. But Lisa said she agreed with former Scientology spokesman Mike Rinder and other former executives who said Shelly was being held at a small mountain compound in the San Bernardino Mountains.\n\u201cShe is at that place at Arrowhead. She\u2019s under 24/7 guard.\u201d\n\nLisa said she was having dinner with Miscavige after Shelly\u2019s disappearance, and noticed he was eating off the same plate as his \u201ccommunicator,\u201d Laurisse Stuckenbrock. When she asked where Shelly was, he said \u201cCompilations.\u201d\n(Miscavige's response was a reference to a specific kind of work done in Scientology, and not a particular location. It was a response intended to convey that Shelly was on a special mission somewhere.)\nAnd Miscavige himself?\n\n\u201cWhile I was beginning to realize how fucked up everything was, and how many criminals there were, I had dinner with him at Nobu four years ago in London. Listening to him talk about how great Scientology was doing was like hearing Hitler talking about how he has chimneys and smoke coming out of everywhere. All he could talk about was Tom or buildings. A four-hour dinner.\u201d\n\nSeveral times during our conversation, Lisa said that things had changed after 2013, when Leah Remini\u2019s defection from Scientology had become public.\n\u201cMy mom is still friends with [a Scientology attorney who] told her that Dave is so paranoid now, nobody sees him. Nobody sees him. He\u2019s going into an underground bunker period,\u201d she said, with a laugh, making a reference to the name of my website.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going into that bunker phase.\u201d\n\nLast week, I sent a lengthy and detailed message to Scientology spokeswoman Karin Pouw, asking for responses to Lisa\u2019s assertions about the church, about David Miscavige, Shelly Miscavige, and what she had to say about her treatment in the church at the hands of her mother Priscilla Presley.\nI am still waiting for a response.\n    \n                                                    \nIn 2013, I was in New Braunfels, Texas to cover a court hearing in a lawsuit filed against Scientology by Monique Rathbun, the wife of former Scientology official Marty Rathbun.\n\nAt the time, Marty and former Scientology spokesman Mike Rinder had pointed out to me that Lisa was in town that night, performing on her \u201cStorm & Grace\u201d tour. Mike joked about going to the concert to see if we could get in.\nNow, in 2015, Lisa told me that Scientology was actually very concerned about that.\n\u201cOSA called my security guys. \u2018These guys are planning on coming,\u2019 they said. They meant Mike, Marty, and you.\u201d\nLisa said her security guys were very worried about it, but she said what was the worst that could happen?\n\u201cLet\u2019s say they pay a hundred bucks for the meet-and-greet. I\u2019m not going to be rude. I'll shake their hands and say hi.\u201d\n\nShe said she even tried to call Miscavige about it, asking him to calm down the OSA operatives. But she was told that \u201cafter the Leah thing,\u201d he wasn't talking to anyone.\n\nI first started noticing that something seemed to be up with Lisa when she released a single in April 2012 that contained lyrics suggesting she might be pushing Scientology away. She followed that up a month later with an album, Storm & Grace, that contained lyrics that seemed unambiguous. And in interviews at that time she talked about getting rid of people she called \u201cnuts\u201d from her life."

      "body": "Part 4:\n\nNow, in 2015, she told me I had been right.\nFrom 2007 to 2015, Lisa said, she was carefully asking questions, looking into what was being said about Scientology, all of the things that eventually came out in a documentary like Alex Gibney\u2019s HBO documentary Going Clear. (Full disclosure: I appear in the film.)\n\n\u201cFor the last eight years, I\u2019ve been putting together everything that was in that special,\u201d she said.\nIn order to do that, she was questioning her close friend Ron Miscavige, who had escaped from Int Base in 2012. And also Roanne Horwich, another close friend who had escaped from the base that same year. Roanne is the daughter of Diana Hubbard, the last of L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s children who are still involved in the Scientology organization.\n\nBut Lisa said she had to proceed very cautiously.\n\u201cWhile I was questioning Ron and Roanne, my mom and daughter were still in. I had to be real careful. I didn\u2019t want to get them in trouble.\u201d\n\nShe said that she reached out for information to other people who \u201cwere not technically declared.\u201d In other words, people who had quietly left Scientology without raising the ire of the church, which declared enemies \u201csuppressive persons,\u201d and then often targeted them with harassment.\n\nLisa said she cultivated sources who were still flying \u201cunder the radar\u201d and appeared to the church to be members in good standing, but who could tell her about what outsiders said about Scientology.\nShe says that\u2019s how she first learned about \u201cThe Hole,\u201d and it helped her make up her mind to leave Scientology. \u201cNo way, that\u2019s not why I joined this,\u201d she said about the bizarre office-prison.\n\nMiscavige had created it in 2004 to punish top executives of Scientology\u2019s Sea Org by locking them into a set of offices in a double-wide trailer at Int Base, the large compound near Hemet.\nThe existence of the Hole was revealed in a 2009 expose by the Tampa Bay Times, and it highlighted how ruthlessly Miscavige disciplined his underlings. Some of his top lieutenants had literally spent years in confinement, forced to accuse each other of disloyalty to Miscavige in brutal \u201cseances.\u201d\nLearning about The Hole was one of the things Lisa said she had been doing for several years, investigating what was really going on in Scientology from the three sources she really trusted.\nBesides Ron and Roanne, the third source was Arthur Hubbard, 64, son of L. Ron Hubbard, an artist who lived in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cArthur was my best friend since I was 16,\u201d she said.\nIt\u2019s particularly interesting that two of her sources for information about Scientology\u2019s controversies were members of the Hubbard family itself.\nRoanne Horwich is L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s granddaughter. (She declined to be interviewed for this story.) And Arthur Hubbard is L. Ron\u2019s youngest child. (He didn\u2019t return a request for an interview.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad. Roanne was living like a gardener at the base, and she was treated like shit. Her mother, Diana, got totally screamed at. She writes the events for Miscavige, she writes those and gets screamed at. There is a whole family that\u2019s been broken apart,\u201d Lisa said.\n\nShe had asked Arthur, why doesn't the family unite and mutiny? She mentioned to me that she\u2019d talked to him about it just the day before. But inertia was preventing anything from happening.\n\u201cArthur\u2019s always like, \u2018OK, beatings, The Hole, OK. But you need a smoking gun.\u2019\u201d\nBut that\u2019s why, she added, the police report from Wisconsin that she had delivered to the Los Angeles Times was so important.\n\u201cIt is a smoking gun.\u201d"

      "body": "Part 5:\n\nFor Lisa, the final showdown with Scientology took place in October 2014.\n\nThat month, she heard from Ron Miscavige that he had traveled from Wisconsin to Florida in order to be reunited with his two daughters for the first time since he had escaped from Scientology\u2019s Int Base in 2012.\nBut when he approached his daughter Denise Gentile\u2019s house (Denise was David Miscavige\u2019s twin), he had been told that he wasn\u2019t going to be allowed to see her or her younger sister, Lori Verneuille, on Dave\u2019s orders.\n\n\u201cRon was heartbroken. He and I had previous conversations, and he wasn\u2019t going to write a book. But now I knew he was really upset,\u201d Lisa said. (Ron told me the same thing, that he wasn\u2019t planning on writing a book after his escape until he was prevented from seeing his daughters. Then he began work on what would become his 2016 memoir, Ruthless: Scientology, My Son David Miscavige, and Me. Ron died in 2021 at 85 years old.)\n\nIncensed by how Ron was being treated, Lisa decided to go to Florida herself.\n\u201cI was just going to go there and see if it\u2019s as bad as everyone said. So I went to the headquarters in Clearwater.\u201d\nShe wanted to talk to David Miscavige and ask him directly why he wasn\u2019t allowing his father to visit Dave\u2019s two sisters.\n\nAnd she wanted me to understand that she had previously considered David Miscavige a good friend.\n\u201cHe and I used to talk for hours and hours,\u201d she said. \u201cBut since the Leah thing [referring to Leah\u2019s public defection in 2013], he was real careful who he talked to. I had to be super careful.\u201d\n\nThat October 2014, she went to the Flag Land Base.\n\u201cI was there looking for closure,\u201d she said.\nThen, she got a phone call.\n\u201cIt just so happens Ron called me. I told him I was on my way. He said, \u2018Can I help you? I\u2019m here. What the fuck are you doing there?\u2019\u201d\n\nRon was still in Florida, and he was confused about what Lisa had in mind, she explained. But she admitted that she wasn\u2019t too sure herself.\n\u201cI don\u2019t fucking know, I told him. I\u2019m here with a wand checking for bugs in the hotel room. I don't know.\u201d\nLisa, her husband Michael Lockwood, her son Ben Keough and other members of their entourage had checked into the Fort Harrison Hotel, the centerpiece of Scientology\u2019s \u201cspiritual mecca.\u201d And she was still trying to figure out what she was going to do there.\n\u201cI just know that I started to self-destruct because this thing [Scientology] is corrupt. I needed closure.\u201d\nRon asked if there was anything he could do, but she asked him if he had Scientology private investigators tailing him. Yes, he answered. That made Lisa wary.\n\u201cThey were being followed. He said he wanted to get together, but I told him no, not right now.\u201d\nShe said that Ron was skeptical she\u2019d even be allowed in to see David Miscavige when she went to his offices.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018The obvious is going to happen. You\u2019re going to get to their door, and they\u2019re going to slam it in your face. Is there anything I can do to help?\u2019\u201d\nBut Lisa said she wasn\u2019t going to back down.\n\u201cDave is too fucking scared to talk to me. I\u2019m in the belly of the beast. It was his terrain, but I was obviously not afraid. He\u2019s afraid,\u201d she said.\nShe made her first attempt to see Miscavige, going across the air bridge from the Fort Harrison Hotel to the Flag Building, a city-block sized edifice which had been opened just the year before. She asked to be shown to the offices of the Religious Technology Center, the nominally controlling sub-organization of the Scientology movement which counts David Miscavige as its chairman. (Scientologists often refer to Miscavige as \u201cC.O.B.\u201d, for chairman of the board.)"

      "body": "Part 6:\n\nShe was let in to the office by a Sea Org staffer who had a Blackberry and an earpiece, Lisa remembered, and she recalled that the woman\u2019s name was Joanna.\nJoanna said that Miscavige wasn\u2019t there. But Lisa saw cameras, and she assumed he was watching. She picked out a camera and spoke to it directly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you. Are you throwing everyone in The Hole? You just made the biggest mistake of your life, you just broke up your own family,\u201d she said to the camera, assuming that Dave was watching. \u201cSomebody needs to stop you.\u201d\n\nAfter her initial visit to the office, she says she was called at the hotel and asked to come back in.\n\u201cThey called me back in. They said, \u2018we have a problem \u2014 you can\u2019t be here if you\u2019re in touch with Ron Sr. He\u2019s a declared SP.\u2019 So Ron, who had saved Dave\u2019s life by getting him into Scientology when he was 9 years old, Ron is now a declared SP,\u201d she said, referring to Ron first bringing his family into Scientology in the late 1960s in order to find a cure for young Dave\u2019s asthma.\n\nWhat about Roanne, she asked? Yes, Roanne was a declared SP as well and Lisa shouldn\u2019t be associating with her.\nLisa said she was told that Denise and Lori, Dave\u2019s sisters, were waiting to talk with her.\n\u201cGive me 20 minutes,\u201d she said. She left the offices and called Arthur. He suggested that she at least find out what the sisters had to tell her.\n\nSo she went back in, with her husband Michael Lockwood in tow. She remembered passing the camera again, and this time said to it, \u201cOK, buddy, action. This is all for you,\u201d again with the assumption that Dave was watching.\nShe and Lockwood found a place to sit. Then Denise and Lori were shown in by Joanna, the Sea Org staffer.\n\n\u201cDenise starts screaming at me. I\u2019d met her before. I wouldn\u2019t say we were friends. She\u2019s screaming about how Ron had beat her mother. How he would drink when he was looking over the kids.\u201d\nLisa said that Denise and Lori were also screaming shocking allegations about their older brother, Ronnie Jr.\n\n(Denise and Lori made similar allegations in a 2016 letter to ABC News to protest the publication of Ron\u2019s book, a letter which Scientology has posted online.)\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get a word in edgewise. I remained completely unemotional while Denise was screaming all kinds of crazy shit. It was all a show for Dave. I kind of had a smile on my face the whole time.\u201d\n\nDenise\u2019s rant culminated with her telling Lisa to keep out of their family matters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s none of your fucking business!\u201d Denise screamed at maximum volume.\n\u201cI\u2019m done, Denise. Good job,\u201d Lisa said she replied. \u201cI tried to be as calm as possible.\u201d\nShe looked at the Sea Org woman, Joanna, who had shown them all in.\n\n\u201cI looked over at his little henchwoman. \u2018That was not a two-way conversation,\u2019 I said.\u201d\nShe said Joanna replied, \u201cThey\u2019re public and we don\u2019t have any control over them.\u201d (She meant that Denise and Lori weren\u2019t Sea Org \u2014 they were \u201cpublics\u201d \u2014 and so she couldn\u2019t tell them what to do.)\nLisa said she told the Sea Org officer, \u201cThat was supposed to handle me? If that was on YouTube, do you think anyone would ever walk in here again?\u201d\nShe and Lockwood went back to the Fort Harrison Hotel, and her son Ben was there. (She said that Ben wasn't a Scientologist.)\n\nLisa went back again to the office the next day. She walked in and told Joanna, \u201cTurn the cameras on. Have him watch what I have to say.\u201d\nShe then addressed Joanna: \u201cI at least need you to acknowledge the fact that was a tiny iota insane,\u201d Lisa remembers telling her. \u201cThis is the SS, Dave is Hitler. I didn\u2019t join this. I want nothing to do with this. My family will have my back.\u201d\nWhen Joanna asked her what she had told her family, Lisa said she responded, \u201cNone of your fucking business what I tell them.\u201d\n\nShe said Joanna replied, \u201cYou need to go into confessional now and get your overts off.\u201d\nIn other words, the Sea Org official was trying to \u201chandle\u201d Lisa\u2019s \u201cupset\u201d by putting the onus on her to confess to bad acts or negative thoughts (\u201coverts\u201d) in order to convince her that she was at fault for what was happening.\n\n\u201cI told her \u2018Fuck you. You're trying to shut me the fuck up and you're not going to do it.\u2019 She told me that I could leave. \u2018Fine, I\u2019m leaving. And when I walk out that door, you\u2019re never seeing me again.\u2019 As I stood up and walked out, she said she would let me know if they declared me. \u2018I\u2019ll let the whole world know if you do,\u2019 I said.\u201d"

They\u2019re completely insane,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter the confrontation, Lisa said she took her family to Disneyworld. Ron Miscavige went to visit Mike Rinder, who lived not far from the Flag base. Ron called her telling her that he was being watched intently by Scientology\u2019s private investigators.\n(Also, Ron\u2019s wife Becky Bigelow was with him. I spoke to her recently, and she says that Lisa\u2019s version of what happened matches her own memory of it.)\nLisa told me that she talked to both her mother Priscilla and her daughter Riley about the encounter, and told them that she needed them to side with her against the church.\n\u201cMom, I know you love doing your courses. But you\u2019re going to have to have my fucking back,\u201d she says she told Priscilla.\n\nWhen I asked specifically about it later in\u00a0the conversation, Lisa confirmed that when she broke with Scientology for good in 2014, she took Priscilla and Riley out with her. \u201cThey walked when I did.\u201d\nShe said that she had also convinced her mother to watch Going Clear, the HBO documentary that had premiered just a month before our conversation.\nMike Rinder, the former Scientology spokesman who recently put out a book about his experiences, A Billion Years: My Escape From a Life in the Highest Ranks of Scientology, tells me he also spoke to Lisa about her attempted showdown with Miscavige shortly after it happened.\n\u201cWhat you are saying matches precisely with what she was saying to me,\u201d Rinder tells me.\n\n\u201cThat meeting with Denise and Lori, she went on and on about, \u2018What c***s they were,\u2019 and, \u2018If Dave thought sending his ugly sisters to see me is going to take care of this, he\u2019s crazy.\u2019 Lisa was really over-the-top upset about the whole thing,\u201d Rinder says.\nShe had called Rinder after they had reached a house in the Nashville area that she was renting at the time.\n\u201cRiley was there with her and got on the phone. I had never spoken to her in my life. The first thing she said to me was, \u2018You\u2019ve got to take these motherfuckers down.\u2019 I was thinking in my head, wow, that\u2019s quite an introduction to Riley,\u201d Rinder says.\nLike her mother, Riley was upset about how Scientology had handled the matter, and wanted the organization\u2019s abuses exposed, Rinder explains.\n(Later, I saw signs that suggested that both Priscilla and Riley may have gone back into Scientology. I sent requests for comment with detailed descriptions of Lisa\u2019s assertions to attorneys for both Priscilla and Riley.)\n\nSoon after the attempted confrontation with Miscavige at the Flag Building, Lisa said she hired a \u201cbad ass lawyer,\u201d who then obtained the police report about the two private investigators who were arrested while stalking Ron Miscavige in Wisconsin the year before, in 2013.\n\nShe sat on it for a few months, and she says it was Arthur Hubbard who convinced her to get the information out to the public.\nIn his book, Rinder revealed that he suggested to Lisa\u2019s attorney that she should deliver the documents to Kim Christensen at the LA Times, resulting in the April 8, 2015 bombshell.\nLisa\u2019s fingerprints were nowhere to be seen, however. I asked her why she wasn't following Leah Remini\u2019s lead and being more public about leaving Scientology and opposing David Miscavige.\n\u201cThe actual reason is, I have two nannies. They\u2019re both Scientologists. My children are so in love with them. And I have a security executive guy who works with me, and he\u2019s a Scientologist.\u201d\n\nShe worried about her children being \u201cdestroyed\u201d if they were to lose the nannies. (The twin girls were 6 at the time of this interview.) \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing holding me back. Believe me, when I want to go, I go.\u201d She told me that she did plan to go public about Scientology once that situation had changed.\nShe also told me that in the meantime, she thought she could do just as much damage from behind the scenes, with the LA Times story as a prime example.\nAnd her goal of going after David Miscavige?\n\u201cGetting the tax-exempt status revoked. That\u2019s the only thing you can do,\u201d she said. Scientology had famously bullied the IRS into giving it tax-free status in 1993, and until that was taken away, she said, it would be business as usual for Miscavige.\nI asked if she had thought about talking to government officials about it directly. \u201cNo,\u201d she answered.\n\nIf she was still maintaining a low profile publicly, inside Scientology her departure was already being talked about, she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m a suppressive person, and I\u2019m the reason my dad died and MJ died. That\u2019s what\u2019s being said inside Scientology.\u201d"

Scientology\u2019s \u201cethics officers\u201d had convinced the parents not to cooperate with law enforcement in order to bury the problem.\n\nLisa\u2019s godchild was among the alleged victims, and she thanked me for making the story public. I took the opportunity to point out that Ron Miscavige\u2019s book was going to be coming out at some point, and that it would probably contain references to her attempted showdown with Miscavige.\n\nI told Lisa that I intended to publish a story about that of my own, but hold back that the details had come from her. She said she didn\u2019t mind. It was very clear that she wanted the information about Scientology\u2019s abuses she\u2019d witnessed to come out. (My story about her battles with Miscavige came out the following April.)\nThat July 2015 conversation was the last I heard from her.\n\nBefore too long, Ron Miscavige said he had also stopped hearing from her.\nOver the next few years, Lisa\u2019s life appeared to become a mix of litigation, substance abuse, and personal tragedy as she went through years of a nasty divorce and custody battle with Lockwood, and then lost Ben Keough, her son, to suicide in 2020. He was 28.\nIncreasingly, I saw signs that Priscilla and Riley were involved with the church again. Had Lisa gone back in as well?\n\nThis past November, there was a stunning development when the prosecutors in the forcible rape trial of Scientology celebrity and That '70s Show actor Danny Masterson revealed that they were planning to call Lisa as a witness to describe what amounted to obstruction of justice by the Church of Scientology.\n\nOne of the three women accusing Masterson of rape, who goes by the name Jane Doe 1, alleged that the actor had attacked her in April 2003, and that she had subsequently informed Scientology about it. She also asked the church for permission to violate Scientology policy and report Masterson to the LAPD. She ended up doing so in June 2004.\n\nLisa would testify, Deputy DA Reinhold Mueller told Judge Charlaine Olmedo on November 8, that she was instructed by Scientology to dissuade Jane Doe 1, a close personal friend of hers, from going to the police.\n\nMueller also revealed that Lisa\u2019s attorney had warned that if they asked her about this on the witness stand, he would advise that she take the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination.\n\nIn other words, Lisa\u2019s own attorney realized that she would be testifying not only to a crime committed by Scientology, but one she had taken part in herself.\nMueller said he told the attorney too much time had passed for there to be legal exposure for Lisa, but he was willing to grant her immunity for her cooperation. With that agreement Lisa then came down to the DA\u2019s office and was interviewed and signed a statement.\nBut Judge Olmedo ruled that the testimony about Scientology\u2019s obstruction was more appropriate for the civil harassment lawsuit filed by the Masterson accusers, and less relevant in a criminal trial about his guilt or innocence. She ruled that Lisa couldn\u2019t testify about it, and prosecutors decided not to call her at all. (The trial ended in a mistrial on November 30 when jurors were unable to come to unanimous verdicts on all three counts of forcible rape.)\n\nHowever, the fact that Lisa was even contemplating testifying about Scientology using her to commit a crime was powerful evidence that she was still out.\nI texted her at that point, hoping that she might finally be ready to talk again after seven years. I got no reply.\nOn Thursday, January 12, 2023, she went into cardiac arrest and died after being rushed to a hospital. She was 54.\nAlmost immediately, I began seeing questions about her death and her association with Scientology, and that she was at least theoretically still a potential witness in Masterson\u2019s re-trial, which is scheduled to begin jury selection on March 29.\n\nWhile I understand the reason people are wondering about that timing, it\u2019s important to remember that Elvis Presley\u2019s mother died of a heart attack at the age 46 in 1958. Elvis was 42 when he died of cardiac arrest in 1977. That heredity, and Lisa\u2019s extensive drug history, didn\u2019t require a conspiracy to explain her untimely demise.\n\nBut her sudden death was deeply unsettling. I felt fortunate to have had the interactions with her that I did.\n\nShe had wanted Scientology and David Miscavige \u2014 whom she\u2019d compared to Hitler \u2014 exposed.\nAnd I wanted the world to know, she had been a fighter."

The movie introduces too many to flesh anyone out, so we get generic stereotypes. The girl with an unnaturally strong connection, the big bro everyone looks up to, the scrappy one, the disappointment. Bro.\n\n>I know you will object to that and put forth some great arguments that aren\u2019t rooted entirely in your subjective dislike of the film. \n\nOf course I'll object. Because it's a lie. Having a blood relative character doesn't make that character fleshed out. It's a short cut. It's the manipulation I mentioned. Just put a kid in there, and anyone with kids will connect by projecting their own kids on the character. No one actually gets attached to the characters, but what those characters represent in the movie goers lives."

You have comics about sports, historical dramas, science fiction, coming of age, romance, all of that.  The Walking Dead is a comic book, Road to Perdition is a comic book.  Look at comic books in Japan or France, there is so much popular there that goes beyond people in capes hitting each other.\n\nYour approach is like someone saying that they hate all music, and their reasoning is that they can't stand country.  Oh, and when their friends tried to get them into something different they were recommended Kenny Chesney.  So based on that they think all music is trash, when in reality the only music they know about is modern country."

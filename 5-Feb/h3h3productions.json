We do a little trolling, it's called we do a little trolling.\n\nSince you're still replying...\n\n\"Fun fact, suppressors don't work at all like in the movies. They primarily get rid of muzzle flash, and while they decrease the sound slightly you should still be using ear protection.\"\n\nWith subsonic ammo, some suppressed guns do work like in movies. Most suppressed guns work almost like in movies.\n\n\"So firstly, it's not about your ears or neighbours (and how many people have shooting ranges in their homes?),\"\n\nWith subsonic ammo the noise isn't enough to warrant hearing protection in most cases. This means being more aware of people around you while shooting and in home defense you won't blast your ears shooting an intruder or aggressive animal. Many people in America with land set up a shooting range, and even in cities people make ranges in their basements. I know people with both.\n\n\"secondly it decreases range and accuracy. So if youre shooting for sport and serious your wearing muffs and would want to fuck up your shot why?\"\n\nSubsonic ammo doesn't suffer the same lack of accuracy as regular rounds. It definitely decreases range but it could still hit a target 100m away. In home defense or just shooting steel plates at the range with a pistol, it's typically 10 meters maybe 50 meters max. Most celebrities are not shooting for sport anyway.\n\n\"Like the pig hunting example, lot of this stuff comes off as really dumb pure cope arguments\"\n\nI don't know the example you're referring to, but pig hunting is a dumb argument for suppressors. The subsonic ammo is only good for hunting smaller game. \n\n\"and I believe the reality has a lot more to do with egos and childish bullshit than any kind of 'need'.\"\n\nWe are talking about a photo of Jeffrey Star plastered in designer with his NFL boyfriend so yeah... \ud83d\ude05 he probably doesn't want to mess up his hair and makeup with muffs. For the vast majority of people, a suppressed pistol isn't a need but rather a luxury item to have fun with and show off. Barely squeezing a finger and hearing a plate of steel go 'ding' without all the 'bang'. \n\nMy whole point is subsonic ammo is a thing, and if you weren't so set on your beliefs you could have looked into it and learned something. If it really matters to you, my degree ranks as one of the hardest majors with careers in many fields and strong annual salaries. One of my courses covered subsonic and supersonic projectiles. You sure wrote your own little narrative too."

I spent several years regularly being on a cattle farm due to my school friend's family running it and saw their full life cycle and got to know the individual cows and to interact with them. \n\nAs I say though it was the mockumentary Carnage by Simon Amstell that made me finally make the switch to vegan from vegetarian."

I\u2019m sure it would affect some other people\u2019s views though. I kept chickens but I still eat and love chicken. I didn\u2019t eat the chickens I kept. They lived outside as a group of 6 and laid eggs.\n\nAs for pushing children to become vegan I firmly believe it\u2019s an individual\u2019s choice to eat what they want aka not forced by parents. If spending time around animals at a young age causes them to personally not see them as food then all the rights to them. However, if it doesn\u2019t then all the rights to them too. It\u2019s their right to come to a decision of their own without any big pressures.\n\nI don\u2019t like being forced ideals onto me be it religion, other beliefs or veganism et al.

It\u2019s like people in Oxford street saying on a megaphone \u201cJesus loves you\u201d or \u201cJesus died for our sins\u201d. \n\nAs for documentaries on the farm industry, they do present truths but also show too much bias resulting in some inaccuracies and sensationalisation."

None is relevant to you, except perhaps as you rightly perceived that any loss of alveolar bone and shrinkage of the dental arch can cause problems: especially but not only if braces are used to close the space and retract back the arch.\n\nMy concern in particular in your case is if the arch shrinks on one side, then you are left with an asymmetrical arch.   As you can tell from the article, anything that happens to the dental arches will affect the structure of the face.   An asymmetrical smile can result, as can one side of the mouth being a bit more inward than the other.  TMD can result if the occlusion force changes.\n\nThese are the worst case scenarios but I would never just let a space close, knowing what I know about how it can possibly cause  irreparable consequences."

Most of the time we are late is not any fault of our own, either the lorry got to our depot late and in turn made every other driver late, traffic, route closures, and lastly customers, especially on am shift quite alot of people are still in bed and only wake up when your knocking on there window because they didnt hear the one at the door lol"

And the state defines what is a valid ceremony and what isn't, for example excluding minority religious ceremonies such as handfastings, until recently refusing to recognise same sex spouses, currently refusing to acknowledge marriages that include more than two people. So marriage as an institution enforces particular relationship norms that don't work for everyone."

It needs to be able to take a ton of requirements, be able to produce code that is extensible and easily maintainable, suitable for the use case, be able to change existing functionality when new requirements inevitably come in from the client after its already produced half of the project. Then it needs to update it in the future when another addition needs to be added which requires a rewrite of the existing code. \n\nOh and then it needs to ensure its bug free, which it won't be able to do easily. \n\nRight now ChatGPT gets all its info from Pre-2021. That's 2-3 years of changes which its not accounted for. A lot changes in the dev world in 3 years."

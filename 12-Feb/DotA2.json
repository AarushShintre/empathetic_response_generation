The only thing I can say is try to get into a herald lobby (some streamers do this) and you'll feel it's easier than default bots. There's zero game sense - as anyone >4k MMR, you won't even need to try (unless there's multiple smurfs).\n\nYou seriously overestimate how much griefers can do at this MMR. A 7k griefer KNOWS to buy wards, smokes, and also boots to feed mid. These guys literally afk trees to \"grief\" - they don't understand the game enough to block camps, etc.\n\nEdit: More importantly, who will they feed?

Macro game and team play is better, but individual skill falls off a cliff compared to SEA. At least at divine. Anyway, there's no way you're comparing Divine to Herald across servers :)\n\n2. Nope. Other Smurfs would be 2-3k MMR, until the MMR inflation kicks in and you get +100/win. The matchmaker gave me 2x 2k MMR smurfs/game before a 4-5k one. Needless to say, multiple 2ks is still an easy win.\n\n3. I don't. You haven't played in this bracket. I have, even as support (need those tokens). It's unloseable if I played my comfort pos3/4 picks (even on 5, you can play a 4). Hell, I even won as Pudge 5 iirc xD\n\n4. No you don't need to wait - this sounds like someone who hasn't played in herald. I have taken tier 3 as Earth spirit before 20 minutes. You have NO IDEA what you're on about.\n\n5-7. Irrelevant, you aren't understanding how easy it is. I had a feeder who wanted carry. He gave someone an Unstoppable spree my 8 minutes, I just killed that hero 3 times by 10/11 minutes. You just aren't understanding that they will die the same exact way back-to-back without realising their mistake. I didn't even smoke, I just walked up to his lane and used dream coil off CD. It's WAY too easy. They also stop feeding/griefing (usually) if you say you're a smurf. But you can just let them try to outfeed you - he literally couldn't feed as quick as I could kill (BoT + mobility, right?).\n\n8. I get your point, but you aren't getting mine. The game will not match you against someone who can beat you before you end up climbing to guardian. You'll rise too fast for the game to realise you're THAT high in rank (7k). Eventually it'll taper down to 70-80%, true. But not within the first 1k MMR of your boosting journey."

Yes the solution to women being in danger when alone at night isn\u2019t just telling them not to do it at all(for that matter even dudes going out alone are at risk of being robbed or worse by armed people in certain parts of the world) but at the same time if you don\u2019t listen to that what does that really do? Certainly it doesn\u2019t solve anything. It\u2019s rough but you have to deal with the world accordingly to how it is. That danger exists it isn\u2019t going to magically go away any time soon so exercise caution.\n\nThat is the short-term individual scale solution.\n\nNow of course it\u2019s also a problem to leave it at that and just force the potential victims to adjust permanently so it\u2019s also important for the people with the power to do things to implement change to address this issue. But this task cannot be done by individuals it has to be done institutionally through good policing or through communities like volunteer night watch.\n\nSame thing for the kid being bullied. In the short term have them avoid the kids that bully them and the things that get them bullied because sending them out there all gung ho because \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have to be the one to adjust as the victim\u201d is all sunshine and rainbows in an ideal world but practically it doesn\u2019t do anything but let the kid keep getting bullied. As with the women being in danger the critical part here is to not just leave it at that but also, at the same time as teaching the kid what to do to avoid the bullying, contact the people with the power to do things such as the administration, or the bullies parents etc etc and inform them of the situation and implore them to make a move. Cause you as the parent(let\u2019s say) don\u2019t have much power to affect what the bullies at school are going to do to the kid so you have to rely on the ones who can or remove the kid from the environment if that doesn\u2019t work. \n\nNow circling back to this actual situation. The short term solution that you can implement on an individual level is to just mute them because nothing you say is going to change these people\u2019s behavior it\u2019s infinitely more likely to energize them more to increase their harassment cause they get a response. So what does forcing yourself to listen to that crap really do at the end of the day?\n\nLong term solution here is to rely on those with actual power to do anything(game developers/whoever\u2019s in charge of banning accounts I\u2019d imagine) with the report button OR get some sort of community movement going to implore the devs to implement something that makes weeding out misogyny/toxicity easier.(though this one is vastly harder than just relying on the report button obviously). \n\nAlternatively MAYBE you could fight fire with fire and do some sort of thing where you and a group of people will harass back anybody who harasses people over stupid misogynist shit but this is an uphill battle(there\u2019s a lot of assholes in the world you\u2019re outnumbered) and it isn\u2019t sustainable(a lot more taxing on you than it is for the asshole).\n\n\nBasically what I\u2019m saying in a very long-winded way is there\u2019s nothing wrong with using the short term solution of just muting. Not muting and engaging with these people does nothing but invite trouble for yourself, as someone who\u2019s been in numerous internet spitting matches it really doesn\u2019t work to change anything it just tires you out.(and that\u2019s just for normal shit. I imagine it\u2019d be even worse for deeply rooted misogynist shit). It\u2019s just critical to ALSO go for some long term action here. Report\u2019s probably the easiest one to go for as far as that\u2019s concerned)although efficacy is questionable).\n\nBoth. Both is good.\n\nAnyway just my two cents I shall return to the shadow realm from whence I came.(usually just a lurker on here lmao)"

The advice of muting is saying \u201cI want you to be able to avoid this terrible unfair issue and thus I am suggesting a good way for that to happen.\u201d And as previously discussed the critical part for this to not be complacency in a position of privilege is the long term part which comes into play through other methods. \n\nAnd to go back to the dynamics issue, am I, as a dude, not allowed to advise my sister against going out alone at night simply because I am a man and thus part of the demographic that has a tendency to oppress my sister\u2019s demographic?\n\nIdk I think there\u2019s more nuance to navigating power dynamics than simply \u201cMember of Group A can\u2019t say X things to Member of Group B\u201d"

Yes the oppressed shouldn\u2019t have to be the one to adjust to the oppressor but that\u2019s the reality we live in and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge that and give advice accordingly because really nobody has the individual power to do anything about it. All we can do is try in whatever small ways we can to contribute to getting something done about it. That includes what you say about checking myself and the people I hold influence over but I see no reason why these things have to clash with the giving of the aforementioned practical piece of advice. Both can be done. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think describing well-meant advice as \u201ctelling a grown ass woman what to do and what not to do\u201d is a very charitable way to look at it.\n\nPersonally unsolicited advice is not something I think people should be giving out willy nilly but in a case of personal connection to someone like a friend I think it is every person\u2019s responsibility to look out for their friend in whatever way they can including the giving of advice when they may encounter a particular situation. Especially if you are witnessing them act against that to their own detriment. \n\nTo go back to the example of a woman going out at night if someone I know and care about intends to go out alone late at night it would be irresponsible of me as their friend to let it happen. Even if they were a complete stranger, concern would be warranted if you witness someone doing such a thing and naturally you would say something about it to the effect of \u201cdon\u2019t do this\u201d. \n\nTo apply it to the subject matter of this post, I can see that OP is willfully subjecting herself to people\u2019s harassment by not using the mute function. Out of a concern for a fellow human being I would advise against it for the previously mentioned reasons and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that just as there wouldn\u2019t be anything wrong with telling a stranger not to go out alone at night when you witness it happening, knowing what could happen to them.\n\nIdk I really can\u2019t wrap my head around how it\u2019s a bad thing to caution people against acts you think might be unhealthy or bad for them regardless of power dynamics. You can do that AND at the same time act in a way to fight against complacency within that system. Both are net goods that avoid bad things happening to other people."

It's the same in Dota -- it's unlikely that the best player in the world that year *also* wins TI just due to pure probability. There's a much higher chance that they are somewhere between 2nd and 4th, or even 2nd and 8th.\n\nNot only that, while /u/Filthy_Joey only listed 8/10 players, it's telling that they listed 6 players playing in WEU + Sumail, who made his bones in NA but has played in WEU for years now. The idea that one single Chinese player (much less other countries outside of WEU) comes up when they thought of their top 8 players of all time is telling."

Top 2 on second places in majors are all EU teams too + 1 tied for 3rd. EU teams have won 17 out of 25 majors (probably would have won more if not for 2020 cancelations).  \n\nThere have been 0 majors with CN only finals. 1 TI with CN only finals. 2 out of top 5 most major wins are CN but just barely. 1 team in top 5 for second places in majors. CN teams have won just 6 out of 25 majors.  \n\nIt should be no surprise that EU players make up most of a top 10 players list."

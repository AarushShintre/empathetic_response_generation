By your metric almost no one can be treated mature adult. Can we stop trying to randomly decide adult people are not adult enough?"

The problem comes from the same place as my comparison to Ben Platt.  A poor mismatch of actor to role can remove your suspension of disbelief.\n\nWe can do both still.  A 9 year age gap gives me the ick when he is one and a half times her age.  Not that it was his choice.  He was just chosen for the role and my point is he was a poor choice.  Maybe we should draw parallels to him being a literal monster in show?\n\nDoes every comment on reddit need a dissertation?  By all means let's discuss the trends in America surrounding the job market, housing crisis, and the latest marriage rates by age and the related divorce rates that all point to independence being acquired later in life due to the gross concentration of wealth and how the ever-changing views on global impact have affected how late couples are having kids."

      "body": "I don't think views on global impact have real impact on how late couples are having kids, everything I've read or heard is that lack of financial stability and, for women, fear of damage to career opportunities are the main drivers of \"few kids at late age\" scenario.  This isn't so much lack of independence as much as stability - young people shack up happily all the time, but don't want to have kids if they don't know for sure they can care and provide for them in addition to themselves. \n\nI don't really care much about the show, I just dislike the \"maturing until 25\" argument, because it's IMHO patronizing argument that denies actual adults their maturity and undermines them as a social and political grouping, could as easily be used for uneducated people (can finished-elementary-school guy marry college educated woman without power imbalance?) and so on, besides if you look at stuff like climate change it's not the under-25 crowd that shows on average lack of understanding of consequences - Boomer jokes are popular for reasons."

      "body": "It would be unfair to try and blame having kids later in life on any one factor.  I think there is a general unease and anxiety for the future of the planet that has a lot of educated youths being averse to even having kids in the first place.  But also yes stability is established later in life and people are finding it harder to move out than ever before.  I see a lot of new constructions that are including a third garage intended for the college student that hasn't moved out.\n\nHell I think \"kids\" should be voting more than ever.  All the boomers got to have that in their youths, collectively voting for the change they wanted to see.  Real shame we're now being held back by them.  A secret I learned growing up though is that we're all still kids inside.  I idolized growing older like they had everything figured out but you're never too old to make mistakes or to learn.  And as well I made a point that coming from a college town, all the 20 year old college students are no different than the day they graduated high school.  They are no less dependent than they were 2 years ago.  In the case of a 20 year old and a 29 year old, the problem comes with imbalanced stages and experiences.  The responsibility is on the older one in the relationship to use that knowledge well but typically we find it is associated with predatory behavior.  I guess women have to learn at some point that age does not mean wisdom and those 9 years could be the very difference in spotting ill intentions."

      "body": "Having read some of these I'd like to second these recommends and comment on a few of these so OP has better idea. \n\nAse to Sekken: more wholesome than the rest I've read. All drama is resolved quickly. The art is beautiful too.\n\nGomashio To Pudding: Short but sweet manga. There is drama that escalates but gets resolved just as quick. \n\nAsper Kanojo: Deals with themes such as mental disorders but is a wholesome read overall. I learned a lot reading this manga and it made me do research on my own about mental disorders amd how to help people that have them. \n\nTaiyou no ie: sometimes the drama feels unecessary and doesn't get resolved quickly but it's part of the story and I think the story wouldn't be the same otherwise. Its definetely scores on the wholesome part and the art is just as good. It is kind of a love triangle(s) ig\n\nFutari no Renai Shoka: nothing to say here, fits your description exactly."

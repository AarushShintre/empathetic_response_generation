For example, imagine how hard it was to communicate to your peers about vector fields before the concept of a vector was invented; having a word to easily encapsulate the mathematical meaning makes it easy for us to have discussions about velocity and magnets without using any actual number or formulas.\n\nSorry, don't mind my rant, I just feel like there needs to be a better way of teaching and communicating things in this field."

The only thing getting in the way in the arbitrary cost incurred on us by our current system. \n\nWhat do you mean exactly? i will give a few examples, but it might not be what you had in mind. \n\nfully switching to renewables? we don't have the production capabilities to \"just do it\". even with all the money in the world, that takes time and money to build. But without base-load generation, we're going to need a lot of batteries. we don't currently have a viable way to store power on that kind of scale, (unless you want to throw Li-on batteries at the problem? they're not a good solution. They require rare materials that we'd need to obtain from somewhere, current tech is designed for density rather than longevity, etc...). I wouldn't consider this \"possible\", realistically. Unless of course, we just dramatically reduce electricity consumption. but guess what, that's where your lifestyle falls apart. completely. \n\nMaybe you meant something else, how about meat? red meat particularly, but also some seafood and whatnot. exploitative farming is terrible for the ecosystem. we could ban much of that and force either plant-based alternatives or for the lower carbon impact creatures, allow for them to be farmed. but not everything can be farmed. and some cultures have those foods take a huge cultural significance (china, japan, ...), so now you've screwed them over. and those alternatives are going to be a lot more expensive, which in turns leads to much fewer people being to afford them, which hurts the very poorest the most. \n\nFinally, let's consider recycling. we have the technology to recyle quite a bit, we also have the technology to phase out single use plastics in most of everything, so, could we solve that by pouring mountains of money on the problem? \n\nIf you were to revamp the entire waste management system, install separate bins, build recycling facilities all over the world, force manufacturers to switch to more easily recycled materials... sure, i guess you could do that. but that would take a lot of money, and even then it would take decades to complete (all the money in the world isn't going to instantly conjure up the tens of millions of labourers you need for this kind of work). \n\nI could come up with more but i think i made my point. money, even when we have the technology (which, we often don't, or not completely), isn't going to solve the problem. Neither is switching to communism (or something else, it really doesn't matter). the system is broken, sure, but ultimately the reason for the struggle is that capital is in fact limited. in any economic system. Capitalism uses money to, among other things, try to represent the underlying cost. \n\nEven if you throw the concept of money away completely, the underlying value is in the time, people, skills that money can buy you. Even with no money, those things are still limited, which limits our ability to do things, in general. it's also why the government can't just use subisidies to make all of these ideas work - you can print money, but you can't print the underlying assets, and that's where you start struggling with the concept of \"cost is the only issue and it's because of this dumb system we live in\". \n\nGiven enough time, you could in fact do all these things (and once researchers solve the remaining issues, too..), but it will stll take a lot of time, kill the rich or not. \n\nThe goal with a carbon tax is to force companies to account for those externalities to motivate them to start fixing those problems themselves. it's not inherently a tax on the poor or whatnot.\n\n> The UN's numbers are made up\n\nYour argument cannot be \"i don't like those numbers therefore they are made up\"."

I have worked on this until I moved quite recently from the R&D organization in my company to the commercial/sales org. I can't reveal the exact information, but maybe a couple of pointers could help you.\n\nSince you said ruthenium, are you gonna be working with Ru-Macho or its derivatives? The focus of industrial R&D has been (heavily) on using catalysts based on Fe, Mn, and Ni. Cost and abundancy are the factors here. I'd suggest, if possible, to design the equivalent catalyst structure using these cheaper metal ions once you do your initial testing with Ru-based catalysts. \n\nWe have noticed a spectacular lack of awareness among different research groups in considering the information published by other groups. This is with respect to the mechanism of CO2 conversion to formic acid, dimethylamine, methanol, etc. A couple of prominent groups have proposed their mechanisms and have focused their observations around their mechanisms, but there are reports out there of contradictory behavior that doesn't match with their proposed mechanisms. I have personally done detailed modeling for the entire mechanistic chain and found that the most widely cited mechanisms are only partially correct. They leave out important information and/or are wrong about the rest of the reaction mechanics.\n\nI know it was a very general description, but don't take the published information on its face value (even if it's from \"famous\" scientists in the domain).

I believe they were using Cu, Ni, Fe and other metals in the vicinity in their work, even though Ru probably exhibits the highest catalytic activity in general. \n\nIt's quite interesting that it can produce hydrocarbons to that length. I have only ever heard of CO and CH4 production via photocatalysis. There was a lot of emphasis on the importance of oxygen vacancies in the research I have heard of (same as it was with thermocatalytic adsorption). \n\nOne of the major reasons for contradictory behavior in this domain (again, same as in the case of adsorption) is that many people focus too much on the effect of metals on catalytic activity and selectivity. The support structure plays too big of role to ignore (for example: see [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27910-4) and [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212982019303002?via%3Dihub)), but it's been changing in the recent years, so that's good news.\n\nAnyway, good luck with your theses, both Master's and PhD."

Go back to the dice example. What if die 1 is rolled inside a completely black box that you have no ability to interact with.

On the other hand, die 2 is perfectly observable but is rolled 1,000 times less frequently than die 1.\n\nOr what if you have a sensor to 0automatically measure and record what number you get for each dice roll. However, the sensor for die 1 is broken and always spits out a completely random result regardless of what the true result is on die 1. In contrast, the sensor for die 2 is known to be 100% accurate, but die 2 is rolled 1,000 times less frequently.\n\nThe idea that it is intrinsically harder to work with die 2 in these scenarios because the events are more rare is just flat out wrong. \n\n> ...and it's something that's very intuitive to all statisticians. \n\nIf the professors in your statistics program are telling you die 2 is harder to work with in those scenarios, you should probably ask for a refund.\n\n>I've tried to explain why that's the case but it's useless if you don't listen\n\nHave you considered the possibility that you don't actually know as much as you think you do?"

At the very least, the context was applying your statement to dice rolls as well. \n\nEDIT: Funny that you don't even attempt to address my claim (e.g., at the very least, the context of your example was meant to apply to epidemiology studies *and* dice rolls). Instead, you just make a reply that doesn't attempt to address this point and then block me."

The former is considerably older in terms of the research on the matter, and the recommended path for those is clearer.\n\nWhen gender identity concerns (typically manifesting as gender dysphoria) first emerge in a child, it is good for a parent to see a psychologist who can then lay out a plan to track this and see whether it persists, as well as to explore the child's concern and where it originates without judgment or weighing on it (either for or against).\n\nIf this gender identity persists through initial pubertal stages (but importantly not before, as puberty has been shown to be a major abating factor for early childhood gender dysphoria), then I think the right course would be to start treatment, but rather than social transition or puberty blockers I think the right course would be to skip immediately to HRT.  Puberty blockers are only proposed as a midpoint for people to deliberate their gender identity, but research has shown that almost all people that go on puberty blockers persist to HRT anyway, so there's no point in my opinion to add an additional complicating medication with other potentially deleterious effects.  The important consideration here is that with the help of a psychologist and a waiting strategy that other mediating factors are ruled out and that the gender dysphoria is shown to be persistent such that transition does become the only good course for positive outcomes.  I don't think this type of case needs to be age-gated in the same way the latter might, but I do think it should be gated by physical maturity (no transition treatment of any type for this group prior to onset of puberty).\n\nFor the second group, I'm far more skeptical.  Notably the first group is mostly natal males, and the second group is natal females, and I don't believe that's a coincidence.  I think a similar sort of course needs to be pursued for this latter group, but for them I'm fairly strong on limiting any treatment to post-puberty since their dysphoria has manifested later.  Very importantly for this case is to eliminate two potential complicating factors, that being generalized depression and anxiety especially as it might relate to the normal mental distress that people experience around puberty, and also the potential for social contagion effects (which likely wouldn't be a problem for the first group).  If the dysphoria persists to 18+ years old, the child now being an adult would have to agency to choose to do what they want, but I don't trust permitting people younger than 18 *specifically of this group* to be allowed medical intervention if the dysphoria has lasted fewer than 2 years or if there are other antagonizing factors such as the two mentioned above."

I'm very much in literature of researchers such as Kenneth Zucker and James Cantor, but what their research would indicate what best practices would be are in direct contradiction with what is actively being practiced right now in the medical profession, namely the notion of \"affirmative care\" and \"informed consent\" (the latter of which I find to almost always be the opposite of how it plays out).\n\nI believe part of this has to do with how strongly the profession has been influenced by activism and political pressure rather than the Hippocratic Oath.  Those bound by the Oath should be interested primarily in limiting any additional and unnecessary damage that could be done by treatment, but instead, the concern right now is in letting the patient take the reigns of control, even when that patient is a child who doesn't know anything and doesn't have the ability to consent to major medical decisions.  Traditionally, *parents* are who make major medical decisions for their children, but their resistance (with good reason) to many of these treatments has lead to the medical profession instead deciding to circumvent this practice entirely."

Aside from the last, these were all researchers on these matters across several decades whose work had been accepted on transgender issues until the sudden change in mood of the past decade.  \n\nThe only real dissenting voice in this timeline of research prior to contemporary concerns was John Money, who did some *very controversial* experiments on [one particular child](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer) in support of his theories of gender.  Nowadays contemporary speakers on the issue align themselves more with Money than with the other set of researchers.\n\nThe issue is that a lot of old scientific work has been thrown out since it doesn't fit the desired model for affirmative care in transgender therapies.  What Zucker's research corroborated by all the others would tell you is that gender dysphoria is a not-too-infrequent condition that often presents in young children, especially those that would grow up to be gay, and usually abates as soon as they start pubertal development.  By contrast, when given puberty blockers, almost none such young gender dysphoric children have their dysphoria subside, but instill carries them to full transition.\n\nThis combines with a problem with a novel population of young teenage girls suddenly becoming the overwhelming majority of transition-seeking patients right now, despite them previously being the absolute minority of cases in prior decades.  Almost none of them also show the typical symptoms and progression that is observed in the much younger-originating and male-dominated gender dysphoric group.\n\nThese things are glaring red flags in the field, and are outright ignored because of convenience.  If you want answers from researchers as to how they view these problems, I suggest you ask them.  You'll find real quickly that they don't have good answers and would rather not."

You have to keep in mind that the stakes for you are getting or not getting sex/a relationship, whereas for women the stakes are getting killed/raped/physically hurt or not.

Depression can certainly put a strain on relationships, but anytime I'm talking with a female friend about her partner with depression, they are discussing things they could do to help them, or simply sharing their worries about their loved one.

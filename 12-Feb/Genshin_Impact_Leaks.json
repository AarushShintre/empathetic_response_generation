Nah, 1000 more ATK doesn\u2019t mean much for Hu Tao when she already has 3500+ from her E. Pryo resonance also does barely anything for Hu Tao, as her Base ATK is the lowest in the game. Also Hu Tao\u2019s charged attacks take her outside of his circle a lot, and there are times when it\u2019s not so easy to get right back in (especially since enemies like to move a lot). Hu Tao does better with dmg bonuses, not attack. And Bennett doesn\u2019t give any dmg bonuses until C6 (a measly 15% pyro dmg).\n\nHu Tao was released as an HP scaler specifically with Bennett in mind, so that she wouldn\u2019t benefit as much. In fact Funerational (Hu Tao double hydro + Xiangling) is better than Hu Tao + Bennett. Xiangling actually puts in some dmg off field unlike Bennett, and every hit will vape with the two best hydro off field appliers on the team. It\u2019s also highly mobile which lets you move around when there are lots of mobs or highly mobile bosses. Hu Tao ironically helps battery Xiangling, and Favonius on Yelan helps even more. And Hu Tao isn\u2019t as single target as you think; her charged attacks go through enemies so you can hit many at once. It\u2019s ironically a team that has Xiangling not relying on Bennett."

Hu Tao already gets a lot of ATK from her E and she isn\u2019t energy hungry for Bennett to battery.

People don\u2019t use shields to survive; they use shields for stagger resist *so they can do more dmg without needing to dodge*. But I digress.\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing clear - I\u2019m not saying Bennett doesn\u2019t improve Hu Tao\u2019s dmg. He does. But there\u2019s more than just \u201cdoes more dmg\u201d to determining who is the best teammate to a character.\n\nYes, a Hu Tao team *with* Bennett does more dmg than a Hu Tao team without - but *how much more dmg*? And what about the caveat that Hu Tao must stay within Bennett\u2019s circle to get the buffs because she cannot snapshot? Low flying enemies? Treasure Hoarders and Eremites who love to back away from you? Teleporting fatui? Kairagi and Nobushi? Hu Tao can\u2019t hit them if she has to stay in circle impact. Whereas ironically Yoimiya (who is considered inferior to Hu Tao) can hit enemies in circle impact because she is ranged. You could already argue that Bennett is better for Yoimiya than he is for Hu Tao at this point.\n\nAnd before you say \u201cdon\u2019t use Hu Tao for those enemies then\u201d, do you even know what fun in personal preference is? If all a character\u2019s worth is more dmg to you, you must have a very sad life.\n\nThis is a similar reason to why Eula and Bennett aren\u2019t seen very often together anymore. Yes, a Eula team with Bennett provides the *highest nominal dmg values*, but it comes with the restriction of being unable to move out of that circle while your enemies can simply move out of range. This is the same case with Hu Tao.\n\nOnce again, yes a Hu Tao team with Bennett provides the highest overall DPS in ideal conditions, *but that does not mean that Bennett alone is Hu Tao\u2019s best teammate*. He alone isn\u2019t providing the biggest boost in the team\u2019s DPS; if you removed the hydro or anemo character from the team, the team\u2019s dmg would decrease more than if you removed Bennett. This is especially true with Yelan teams, as Yelan literally does not benefit at all from Bennett. That to me already means that Bennett is no where near necessary for the team and therefore, can\u2019t be considered the \u201cbest\u201d teammate for her.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between saying \u201cHu Tao\u2019s highest dmging team has Bennett in it\u201d vs saying \u201cBennett is Hu Tao\u2019s best teammate\u201d. Those are two very different things. Bennett makes Hu Tao\u2019s ATK go from 3000 to 4000, an increase in 25%. Yelan increases Hu Tao\u2019s DMG by 50% by allowing her to vape, another 50% via her passive, and contributing even more to her HP to ATK conversion by being half of Hydro resonance or via her C4. If Yelan has Elegy, she buffs even more by providing both EM and ATK.\n\nGoing by your standards, 99% of Genshin players are shit at Genshin because they can\u2019t pull speedruns off and would rather go for the much more consistent, flexible, and easier to pull off teams without Bennett. If that\u2019s not toxic elitism idk what is.\n\nGenshin has no in game leaderboards; 3-stars is 3-stars no matter whether you clear a chamber in 2:59 mins or 30 seconds, you\u2019ll get the same rewards regardless. Therefore, the better thing to ask is \u201chow can I clear with the least amount of worry/effort and most amount of comfort?\u201d rather than the fastest clears possible, because it literally doesn\u2019t matter once you can meet the 3 minute time limit (or max reward tier in events). What\u2019s the point in killing an enemy with 100k HP with a move that does 600k dmg but doesn\u2019t work for every scenario? It\u2019s overkill and too specific. I\u2019d rather do 200k and have it work in more scenarios and allows more flexibility."

Assuming you're right, there is one more major problem. Unless you're in multiplayer you'll have to trigger both yourself and if you're trying to melt Ayaka she has to go first. Ayaka burst runs for 5s. Dehya's burst animation runs for 2s, you'll likely lose a .5s to the act of switching and getting Dehya lined up and starting her burst, enemies will have a cryo aura from Ayaka 4unnunt this whole time, one that will need to be forward melted off by Dehya's first hit causing another delay while you wait for her to flip the aura, if she even can in time at all. You're basically looking at only being able to get melt going for 2 out of the 5s that Ayaka burst runs for. That's abysmal and approaching pointlessness. You'd be better off using someone like Hu Tao who can provide a ton of pyro application very quickly thanks to it being with her skill and no ICD CA or using Xiangling who you can get going before Ayaka burst and will run the whole duration as well as apply in AoE"

Her banner history has been an absolute mess. Her first one was right after Ayaka, a beta character people had to wait a while year for, and followed immediately by the electro fricken archon. Her second banner was surrounded be two of the best supports in the game with Kazuha in his first rerun after being heavily skipped due to people not realizing how good he was, and the damn geo archon, god of shields. Finally, her second rerun came only 2 patches later, which never boads well for sales, and she was ran on the same banner as the brand new dendro archon. \n\n2. The Hu Tao problem. Hu Tao is better, damage wise, in ST, MT, and AoE situations. She also doesn't require a shield due to her selfish heal and frequent usage of dash cancels. What Yoimiya has over Hu Tao is range and a better overvape comp. She is easier to use though, and the could be a deciding factor for people who are picking between the two  She's a very good DPS, but unfortunately she's a hard sell when she can't out damage her competitor I'm any situation\n\n>Shenhe who also don't sell good, even though she has everything that cryo character may need, but even then not every cryo enjoyer have/use her.\n\nThat's a huge difference though Shenhe has versatility. Ayaka is her best dps, but Ganyu get great mileage out of her as well, even Eula can use her. She has cryo damage buffing, cryo resonance, great particle generation even with out fav lance, and even has some physical shred. \n\n>Personally would be interesting to see sales with current state.\n\nMiserable would be my guess, but I'm also curious"

Unlike you everyone wants constellations on a 5star they care enough for to pull for a support that is only optimal with a specific character. It's delusional to see a kit like mika's, literally tailor made for physical carries, out of which there is a singular one and say it isn't a support made for that character. I also brought up how correlation does not imply causation since every banner has at the very least a single 4 star that works well with the 5 star, dedicated supports are even more obvious because (surprise) they are made for the character and it just so happens that 4 star is pretty much the only optimal choice for that 4 star.\n\nIf all of those are not rational arguments and evidence but \"its only ever run with the character\" is then no wonder you are so confidently incorrect.

You fail to see the actual issue with dehyas kit/the game in general.\n\nOP units like Yelan, bennet or XQ didn't stop characters with a well thought out kit, like nahida or nilou to deliver. Dehyas issue aren't OP units, she shouldn't be competing with any of them if hoyo pulled through with an offensively oriented sustaien character\n\nDehyas issue is, that her kit is not well thought out/developed\n\n>Time to move on. We do not need same shit over and over and over again. Yelan Benett Kazuha <insert shiny new character> is simply not the way.\n\nYou mean like Haitham? Ohh wait\n\nYou mean like Nilou? Ohh wait\n\nYou mean like Nahida? Ohh wait\n\nNone of them, especially not nilou need bennet, Yelan or kazuha to perform. And do you know why? Cause their kits are well thought out and not a straight forward DPS, that only wants ATK amd Crit\n\n>So the new characters should not work with \n\nWhy tho? Why shouldn't they? Why should genshin go the way that ruins other gacha games? What you suggest is basically powercreep, but old units aren't completly usless?\n\n>Dehya should become \"new\" Benett/Kazuha/Yelan, and in time, she would become useful and on pair with them. This should be direction with her kit. And maybe it already is but we can't see it.\n\nShe shouldn't. There shouldn't be copies/new versions as new characters. Even Yelan isn't just \"5* XQ\". She offers a tradeoff to XQ. Less utility, but more dmg and dmg buffing\n\nDehyas kit should keep the idea that hoyo had, but develop on it, cause the idea by itself is pretty good if you actually think about it\n\n>People stuck in the past or obsessed about using \"f2p\" units can play their Hu Tao and Yoimiya and Diluc... and Yanfei... and Xiangling... they work just fine. How many more of those do you want?\n\nYou are the one wanting more of them tho? You want a new bennet, new Xiangling or a new Kazuha? \n\nI litterally told you more then often enough, that the idea behind dehyas kit isn't bad, but lacks proper development\n\n>I want characters that work with new things. But to work with new things, you have to deny them old things, because old things are so absurdly OP they will just prefer those instead.\n\nYou could also simply give them a kit that works well on launch and not butcher them cause \"fuck old shit\", just to then sell a character, that fixes them?\n\n>Which means the new things following will also get nerfed, because they also will work with benett and yelan and cant have that and it's a vicious cycle.\n\nExcept not working with bennet is as easy as having non atk/just partial atk scaling?\n\nAnd not working with yelan is as much as not being another pyro vape hypercarry? You don't need to butcher kits to achieve that?\n\n>If Dehya is ever to be good with something new and interesting, she has to not work with Yelan.\n\nOnly true if she would be a hypercarry vape dps...\n\nWhich are most pyro main dps tbf, but cause they can't properly use any other reactions.\n\nBurn is bad and doesn't need constant pyro application, burgeon prefers consistant off field, with low appication on enemys, overload is bad for every melee dps and there isn't a comfortable enough off field cryo applicator, that woul allow for melt\n\nSomeone, that could apply good, consistant off field cryo, similiar to XQ/Yelan would open a lot more options for pyro main dps. \n\nOr a ranged unit, that can track enemys, so overload is less of an issue\n\n\n\nAgain you do not seem to understand the issues you think you are addressing and just go hate on every semi OP unit.\n\nMost of the issues you adress are either extremly exaggerated or are there due to other issues you ignore."

In a quick swap team, you do not stay on a single unit, rather, you put units with valuable elemental skills and bursts, typically with short cooldowns on your team, and cycle between them rapidly. No unit is the individual star of the team, instead, the resource of time is used efficiently to constantly use high value elemental skills, generating a lot of energy and allowing your units to constantly rotate through their high value bursts. \n\nOn field time is a resource in every team, in an effective quick swap team the value of time is instead split between multiple characters rather than one, yet the overall output is not lower. Quick swap teams are in fact very strong, and especially since MHY has specifically added in lots of units recently that do not demand hyper carry field time, such as tighnari.\n\nYou can, however, still calculate an average expected damage per second of your team in a rotation. This is typically competitive with hyper carry teams, which are simply a different way to play the game, and are not mechanically worse. \n\nIn the end, the damage difference between such a team and a hyper carry team is expected to be a factor of the individual units, not the viability of the play style. An allocation of field time for a quick swap team might be something like 20, 20%, 30%, 30%. Each of those units are contributing to your overall dps, with maybe a couple units being dedicated to utility. A hyper carry team\u2019s field time allocation might be something more like 80%, 7%, 7%, 7%. The dps of the two teams is expected to be similar, it is simply the field time allocation between the different units that changes. In a quick swap team, every unit is still expected to hold their weight. In fact, these teams typically demand units that have extra high value abilities. \n\nWhat you have proposed is not fitting her in with a different play style. In a quick swap team, for her to be mechanically worth considering, she still needs to hold here weight. This is not a matter of \u201cplay style difference\u201d, quick swap teams are powerful, some are arguably better than many hypercarry teams. \n\nWhat you have proposed instead is playing her in a team with very low damage, lowering the \u201cstandard\u201d for her burst to be technically worth using.

People are too fucking stupid and stubborn to accept _the game is fucking easy_. You will level your team to 80/90 and you will have an artifact set they can use to clear every piece of content in the game. That is just straight up a fact because the game is so fucking easy waht you get will always be enough. \n\nI've played games where you can actually grind out power and push yourself. They're fucking not the game I want to play because that comes with content and design related to it. If you let the players do it then the players want something to use it on. \n\nIt is fluff because being strong in this game is fluff. It's that fucking simple. I don't want you to be able to farm a team to minmax because then content where you need to will have more reason to exist and I want LESS reason for that content to exist. \n\nYou want the game to be something it was never designed to be."

The famous painting is called \"Monna Lisa\" (= madam Lisa), not MONA Lisa (English translation). The Northern Italian word \"Mona\"(though known across all Italy), which stands for female parts or for incredibly dumb person, has an Arabic/Occitan origin and it means monkey or cat, at the time symbols for sin and lust.

And we can agree on some gripes with how the characters are designed/rendered, and wanting more mature characters.\n\nI just disagree with how you seem to feel that the girls are in a worse position than the guys. Barring your specific complaints, even if we traded the way you're saying in which the way the characters are treated is flipped but we can exchange quantities, it's still a better deal for me by sheer numbers alone. Some math ahead, sorry if I'm dragging this conversation, but I find it an interesting what-if scenario.\n\nCounting all the males to the end of 3.x, we have 14 short guys. Going by a similar standard of picking out characters who look more like teens, I'd say 8 of them do (Bennett, XQ, CY, Razor, Mika, Heizou, Scara, Venti). So out of 24 tall & short males, that means 30% look young and 70% look mature.\n\nFor female characters, if we only count Mona, Ganyu, and Keqing as mature medium females (since we seem to agree on them) and the rest must be tall, then 60% look young and 40% look mature.\n\nWhen you do the math on the number of characters:\n\n40% of 42 playable females = 16.8 mature characters, so I'd get 16-17 mature males out of 42 playable ones\n\n70% of 24 playable males = 16.8 mature characters, so you'd get 16-17 mature females out of 24 playable ones\n\nSo we're the same overall.\n\nIf we did 4 star only (32 total, 10 male, 22 female):\n\n50% of 4 stars look young if you really don't want to count Heizou. So you'd get 5 tall females if we were applying this fairly. But let's pretend you get 10 tall females.\n\n6/22 (27%) female 4 stars are tall, so I should get 6 mature males and 16 young/chibi males. Right now I only have 3 tall (or 5 \"mature\") males anyway. So in this deal, I get more mature males and an additional 16 male characters who are more young/cutesy.\n\nThe male-female 4 star ratio is basically 1:3 so it'd always just scale like that.\n\nSo theoretically, if you accepted the deal and got 10 female 4 stars, you'd only gain 4 additional mature ones but lose 16 additional female characters. And since the male-female ratio is pretty much always 1:3, it'd scale up, so 20 mature for you means 16 mature + 44 young for me. But if I didn't take this deal, then I'd only have 10/20 mature guys while you get 16/60 mature women.\n\nSo yeah I'd jump on this deal. I'm just wondering if you still would. If yes, then that's great, we'd both be super happy in that case."

He was actually worse than every other shielder in the game and did absolutely nothing of value. As for Kazuha, he was doomed as a worse sucrose and an easy skip.

It would especially be worse if it is a family member, because you are more attached to them and they have power over you that others don't due to those bonds.\n\nSeeing the Tsaritsa and going \"Oh ok so you had good intentions but somehow lost your way\" is a much different interaction than \"Why didn't you talk about this with me?

Except for Dottore, I don't think he'll be redeemed or anything similar so he can easily become an accomplice of Pierrot. The Tsaritsa now sees her wrong ways (duh) and helps us defeat Pierrot and the Fatui soldiers under his leadership, thus \"redeeming\" her and the remaining Harbingers/Fatui soldiers.\n\nThis way, Pierrot will become the main antagonist of the Snezhnaya Arc, not The Tsaritsa. That would not only give us an excuse to keep killing Fatui enemies in the overworld after finishing the Snezhnaya Arc, but also would explain why no leaker could confirm Pierrot was going to be playable unlike the remaining Harbingers."

Yes, he wants to help Teyvat, but finding his sister comes first. It's reasonable that the moment he interacts with her he forgets about the Abyss, Teyvat and everything else, because what he cares the most is reuniting with her.\n\nThe Tsaritsa can produce this effect. For all the Traveler cares, she's a woman who's responsible of her friends suffering, he won't ignore all that stuff and focus on her, because she isn't the sibling and she doesn't have that effect on him.\n\nI also wanna add that I don't even think the Traveler is 100% aware that the sibling is the Abyss ruler. He hasn't mentioned something like that even once after meeting her, and is in fact still searching information about her.\n\nThat said, don't get me wrong. I do think he could befriend The Tsaritsa in the end and all that stuff. Why? Because she'll be a playable character. It's practically a rule that the Traveler can't hate playable characters, and they can't hate him either. For example, after Zhongli tricked us, made a deal with the Fatui, and put Liyue in danger, we weren't even a little annoyed by it. Why? Because he's a playable character, and we always have to be on good terms with playable characters.\n\nSo yeah, it's not like I think your scenario is impossible, I just think the current personality of the Traveler *shouldn't* forgive The Tsaritsa's actions... but will likely do so because Mihoyo can't really write a good personality for the main character."

Besides...it also causes swirl reaction.\n\nHold up, I didn't say not to use the skill in combat. Ofc you want to use it, but the personal damage is a drop in the bucket against the swirl and isn't necessarily worth bringing to a high talent level. That's what I meant. \n\n>This best option is too bad for me to have any interest.

He is a short jog from a waypoint, and he is the only enemy with 0 cooldown after fighting him while also not requiring a loading screen refresh. The presence of a fight timer, balanced resistances, and two levels of difficulty also support this. If you want to not use him out of some silly spite factor, then that's your prerogative.

It's a 'free' several thousandths of damage, even if you do basically nothing to raise it.\nI clearly wouldn't even think of raising it to 9, let alone 10, but 7 or 8 is a good point to stop at when taking resources and value into consideration.\n\n> I think you seem to misunderstand something, (...)\n\nI don't misunderstand anything.

Yeah. He may be the training dummy for us, but that does not mean he is a GOOD training dummy for actually testing things. \nIf I wanted to get proper data I still need to use other programs, including some way to record the damage dealt and then painstakingly write it into excel or something. I don't care for taking such extra steps when adding that would be a days worth of work (since all of that is ALREADY generated by the game, there's just no way to see it as a player...without third party tools anyway). MMO's have the argument of \"But it opens the way for cyber bullying!\"...but Genshin Impact does not. It's a single player game with a co-op functionality. Co-op by nature is something you have complete control over. There's nothing forcing anyone to play with a bully, nor is there any to gain from doing that. Anything in the game can be done solo, except for one event in which people wouldn't even be able to request your numbers, really.\n\nI don't know why I even have to write so much on this topic. I literally wrote that I wish we could have a puppet that shows stats. This is exactly what I wrote, and that as a minor side note.

I have no idea what your damage is bro, but not one word of what I said there has any relevance to your intelligence. I was simply offering suggestions on ways around the lack of damage feed problems with 3 solutions, 2 that work with Masanori and one that's a complete alternative. I honestly have no idea why you're so worked up over objectively nothing, all I'm trying to do is help out someone who loves the same game I do. Calm down bro, it's fine. \n\n>means that suggesting a calculator is dumb\n\nDid you bother to click the link in my comment for the calculator? You seem to be conflating the excel calculators that theorycrafters typically use with the user friendly full UI ones that the general Genshin playerbase uses. Here's another link: https://genshin.aspirine.su/ \n\nThere are plenty of other good ones out there as well that all have full UI support. There's also programs such as inventory kamera that make the process of getting your items into the calculator easier. If you dislike 3rd party programs, you can still enter things manually. If all you're doing is comparing the damage difference between 2pcs, then manual entry wouldn't be too much of a pain. \n\n>By the way, GeForce and Radeon tools ARE THIRD PARTY PROGRAMS.\n\nThird part programs that most people have to make keeping the graphics card drivers updated easier. I also included the first party, pre installed program \"Xbox Game Bar\" as well that makes for a great alternative. I listed these three since game bar come on every windows PC, and most people will have the other two already for maintaining computer performance."

Scaramouche is a discarded god puppet who joined one of the major villain factions and. Kazuha is from the remains of a noble house after Scaramouche messed with it. He was also a wanted man throughout the Inazuma AQ after he took his dead friends vision. Ayaka is just an awkward rich girl.\n\nI don't know how lesbian porn would be made for guys specifically but not women.

Also, you can just google \"character name+kqm\". \n\n[this is Sara's kqm page](https://keqingmains.com/sara/)\n\nKqm is the western world's top community for genshin guides. \n\nThere's also kusanalimains with a lot of theorycrafters. \n\nYou can also look up the character name on reddit to find their mains subreddit. \n\nThere's a lot of guides and theory behind character builds. You should explore them yourself when you find the time. I have been playing for more than 1.5 years and it took me quite a while to discover this all and develop this sense. Good luck on your journey!"

It's not much but since the main is Kequin and the other support is Mona (200%+ di ER) she should be fine. But since Sara is my burst sub-dps,I needed more crit.

Vape is amazing, while Melt is not too bad. She is the best for ST, and decent AOE from her burst and somewhat from her CAs. Her kit revolves around HP, and rewards you for being low HP. Her HP drain is far superior to Xiao's as well. And the icing on the cake is that she can heal herself, unlike Xiao. Her teams also are less restrictive. I've used her with Albedo and Yelan before, as well as off field burst support Ganyu, and she's worked out pretty well, even relying solely on herself or Albedo's crystals. \n\n> I just want to show you that your biased tier lists make no sense.\n\nIt makes sense to me and is consistent is all that matters. I rate Hu Tao above Xiao cause her kit is better designed, she has reactions, does a crap ton more DMG for ST while not being terrible at AOE. And also less restrictive."

ICDs exist and get in the way of that. That wouldn't be Hu Tao melting, but the cryo character melting. Even if Xingqiu was Cryo it still wouldn't have enough application to make Melt Hu Tao work.\n\nYes you can. You can make burst nukes work reliably. And XQ being Cryo would be perfect for melt, idk what you're on about. It would literally be the same as vape application.\n\n>  But these teams aren't great. They are blatantly worse than Vape.\n\n> If we are going to mention bad variations\n\nExcept these aren't bad variations. Overvape is pretty good. And loads of people viably use melt Tao for nukes. \n\n> Bullshit opinionated crap yet again. There's pretty much infinite ways you could add a character to improve either one. If you can't think of any that just further shows how narrow-minded you are.\n\nThe only ways I see how they can improve Xiao are either a dedicated Anemo support, like Faruzan, or a Plunge attack buffer. What else?\n\nTao can work with potential future hydro applicators, CA buffers, Pyro buffers, reaction buffers, Cryo applicators, Anemo supports that can swirl reliably for her and more. She would've worked with burgeon as well, but Hoyo fucked that up."

      "body": "Let me put this straight. Reactions is one factor. Having them, is better than not having them. Whether that makes someone a better unit overall, depends on other factors. Units are combinations of these factors.\n\n> Want to provide any proof ever? Want to link any actual evidence instead of just spewing opinions? \n\nWhat kind of proof do you want? I mean, it should be obvious. Ganyu has her CAs with no downtime and burst, both of which have AOE, as well as her E, which taunts enemies, and is also AOE. Her entire kit is AOE, and she can even AOE melt. Ganyu-Venti is the best AOE team in the game, against small mobs. Xiao would be better than freeze Ganyu against AOE with big mobs. But melt Ganyu would be even better. \n\n> If we are talking about small mobs that get sucked by those perhaps they can compete. However there are a ton of enemies that are highly resistant to CC.\n\nThe only mobs highly resistant to CC are like Ruins. Kazuha can suck most others. Venti can't suck big ones, but can if they are frozen.\n\n> My Xiao will be plunging for over 130k AOE damage when Faruzan arrives. And if it's single target I get over 2 million team rotation damage.\n\n> How much damage per rotation does a well built Ganyu, Ayaka, Raiden or Hu Tao team deal? I'll bet that if it is more than that, it's not by a significant margin. \n\nMy Ganyu at C0, without Amos can do 260k CAs per melt with a Shenhe. Can deal about 1 million DMG by herself in 7 seconds. In AOE, a shard of hers can do 20k. Which is 1 million for 50 shards over 15 seconds. Just her own personal DMG. \n\nHu Tao and Raiden are the best single target dps in the game, so let's not even talk about them. In AOE sure, Xiao is superior to them.\n\nAyaka is a burst DMG dealer, and will do like 500k-800k per rotation depending on build and supports. \n\nOfc the DMG difference between them is not that significant, but it's still there. They still do more DMG even if it's not too much, since Genshin is pretty balanced. \n\n> The weak element consumes 1/4 the amount of aura. That means a cryo character would need to apply cryo 4 times for every 1 time Hu Tao applies an element. That's simply not happening.\n\nAnd why can't we get a Cryo character like that.\n\n> So your a hypocrite after all. What happened to \"reaction characters are just better\".\n\nAgain, there is nuance. One factor doesn't make someone better, it's a combination of them. Even cons become a factor.\n\n> Yeah, i'm sure flinging away your enemies with overload when you are a melee character is just great. /s\n\nWhat bosses and massive enemies are getting flung away. That's where you use Hu Tao anyway.\n\n> Link me to any strictly nuke melt Hu Tao abyss clear. I bet you'll get a single chamber, 1 shot clear and will somehow ignore the floors with multiple enemies.\n\nYes, that is what a nuke means. Against small mobs, it's obviously bad. But against big mobs and bosses, pretty good.\n\n> Any sort of Sub-DPS that works efficiently while he's plunging. Any character that boosts damage. Any character that has synergistic CC.\n\nThat is fair, but he does still have lesser potential options because of his element and the way he deals DMG, as compared to Hu Tao and the others. I think these 3 buffs you mentioned are quite universal for every character, rather than just Xiao. \n\n> And as I said in the first place, variety does not directly relate with power level. It doesn't matter if there's more possible flavors for someone else. What matters if what you can do with what you have.\n\nIt doesn't, but it can be a factor. Like when they added Yelan, Hu Tao benefitted so much. One because she got a second hydro applier. Two cause she buffed her DMG, and three cause she got hydro resonance, which buffs her HP, which she scales by. And these are the reasons why Hu Tao is so good. She benefits from hydro resonance and has the ICD to abuse vape with these two. It's a combination of every factor that makes someone better. And Hu Tao just has a better combination of factors going for her than Xiao."

There is no content aside from anemo spectors that he can't steamroll through. So there's never a need to swap your party to something else. \n\n2. He's anemo, so he's already 1/2 for the movement bonus which is huge for the 95% of genshin that is running around the overworld.\n\n3. He has permanent uptime on his damage. When built correctly it doesn't matter that he's \"burst centric\" because you build him to counter that flaw. \n\n4. He isn't bothered by shields. Other characters have issues with shields because they can't apply a proper aura for reactions. \n\n5. He has massive AOE. Even if Mihoyo puts enemies at inconvenient spots, Xiao isn't bothered in the slightest.\n\n6. He only demands 1 slot on the team to be synergistic with him.

He doesn't have obnoxious idle animations. \n\n>Can't see why they can't make a Cryo like that.

An's even you factor in the fact that Xiao's DPS will be improving by ~65%, the rotations become smoother, and take away the constellations that are basically doubling their DPS, yes. It would be very close. \n\nWe don't know if it's 65% exactly. She has been getting plenty of nerfs. Also why would we be taking away their constellations but not Xiao's? That is dumb. And if you're considering them all at C0, they're still too far ahead at ST. And this is WITHOUT considering how much Nahida, Yelan and Shenhe have buffed Raiden, Hu tao and Ganyu. It is not close, I'm sorry.\n\n> So you swap out your team for literally every single activity? Sounds exhausting.\n\nNo, my Ganyu team handle everything not actively resistant to Cryo. Same with Raiden and electro resistant.\n\n> Although I'd argue he's better at swarms than Morgana\n\nHe's not though. Venti and Ganyu together were so broken that Hoyo has to change the way they did abyss. A C0 Morgana scaling is higher than a C6 Eula.\n\n> and as long as there is 2+ enemies better at \"big chunks of meat/metal that venti can't lift\"' as long as there is 2+ enemies.\n\nI mean, I doubt that cause Ayaka is insanely good against those, and Nahida-Ganyu burn melt has taken her to another level."

Obviously characters shine more in favored content. My point with Xiao is that he has competitive single target while absolutely crushing in AOE content. \n\nAnyway, unless your next reply actually has DPS numbers or ither evidence i'm done replying.

So I can only rely on calculations. A C0 Ganyu with an R1 Skyward can deal upto 270k per melt shot with a Kazuha and Shenhe. She can do 3 CAs in 5 seconds, which is essentially 810k DMG in 5 seconds. Hu Tao, can do 75k per vape with a dragon's Bane. It is harder to calculate it for Raiden because of the chaos. But she can match their DPS with an R5 Catch.\n\n> My point with Xiao is that he has competitive single target while absolutely crushing in AOE content. \n\nOr rather he's ok at ST, far behind the others, while being competitive or better in AOE content.\n\n> Because as long as you keep making opinionated statements this argument is not going to go anywhere.\n\nSee difference is, I have provided DPS numbers.

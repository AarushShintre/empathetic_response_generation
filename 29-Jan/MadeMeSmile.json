Mind you there already is a higher tax on investment properties vs ones you live in given homestead tax exemptions many/most localities have in place.\n\nAnything that reduces or doesn\u2019t increase either the stock of rentable or buyable housing inventory, isn\u2019t going to help long term. Having a good stock of rental units is a good thing for poor people, keeps market rental rates lower."

Companies are less likely to do this (imho) given it\u2019s a silly business move to not rent an asset (that can be rented) you have on your books. People buying second homes or vacation homes (including non-US investors speculating in the market) are more likely to be driving that.\n\nhttps://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/extraordinary-and-unexpected-pandemic-increase-house-prices-causes-and-implications"

It's far less likely for someone to have a vacation home that sits empty than for a company to intentionally drive up demand. Those rates should never have been offered to rental companies."

There would be 0 business sense for a business not to rent a rentable property unless they weren't planning on holding it long enough to do so.\n\nBanks tend to own a lot of vacant homes, but not as an investment, but because they've been foreclosed on as a result of default and they need to liquidate them (buying and selling houses is not a bank's core business) as soon as they can.\n\nEither way, my point around a tax on vacant homes stands as a way to not just shift housing stock from rent to buy (which probably hurts poor people), but get more people in houses period.\n\nCensus data from 2017...\n\n[https://data.census.gov/table?q=B25004:+VACANCY+STATUS&hidePreview=true&table=B25004&tid=ACSDT1Y2017.B25004&lastDisplayedRow=7](https://data.census.gov/table?q=B25004:+VACANCY+STATUS&hidePreview=true&table=B25004&tid=ACSDT1Y2017.B25004&lastDisplayedRow=7)\n\nRemember the \"other\" category will include things like foreclosures. Also rentals would be natural churn of leases ending and some units being on the market looking for new tenants."

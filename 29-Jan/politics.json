I hope we can both agree that telling a small child they are racist and theres nothing they can do about it is a bad idea.

I truly hope we can also agree on that.\n\nThe other article while it doesn\u2019t cite 6 years olds being taught sex ed (I\u2019ll concede that claim) I too around 5th or 6th grade had sex ed in school but it did not delve into topics such as anal sex, oral sex, gender identity or sexual orientation. Just the basics of heterosexual intercourse and parents could opt out if they wanted to have that chat with their kids instead. We might agree to disagree that showing an 11 year old depictions of anal sex, oral sex and asking them if they think they should or shouldn\u2019t be their biological sex or be attracted to the opposite sex is appropriate.

Republicans aren\u2019t responsible gov they just cry that the government can\u2019t do X while sabotaging it from within. Another example of that is Obamacare. Obama was very responsible when he took a Republican (Romneys plan as gov of Massachusetts) healthcare plan and instituted it nationwide. A responsible party would\u2019ve made it work, the republicans sabotaged their own plan at every opportunity for a decade just because a democrat passed it. Trumps tax bill raised premium prices and republicans ran this last election in my district on inflated healthcare costs but the media never once calls them out in it.

It creates a tribal mentality.\n\nMy view as a progressive: GOP is a fascist org for enriching the wealthy and hurting everyone else, so I'll never vote for ANY Republican, and 3rd-party is currently a wasted vote. That leaves ONE party to vote for. I didn't like Hillary, but voted for her because Trump was *that bad.* Biden was a little better, but mostly the same. There's no real pressure for Dems to be better, so we'll keep getting \"establishment\" leaders who don't want real change. \n\nYou could say, \"but the primaries!\" The DNC exerts great force to ensure their preferred candidate wins, and Dem voters usually follow the DNC's lead. In 2016, superdelegates were locked in before most debates, and the [DNC conspired against Bernie Sanders](https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/ct-dnc-sanders-glanton-talk-20160725-column.html). In 2020, Biden was trailing until several candidates conveniently dropped out and endorsed him ahead of Super Tuesday, to eliminate the front-runner at the time: Bernie. Add to that the coordinated media effort against him (#bernieblackout) because he threatened rich peoples' money. Progressive ideals align with what [most Americans want](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/27/majority-of-americans-support-progressive-policies-such-as-paid-maternity-leave-free-college.html), but are underrepresented.\n\nIn my mind, both parties have transformed for the worse. GOP became a fascist propaganda machine, and Dems moved more to the center, with a lot of lip service about helping working class, but not much effective action. Citizens United has impacted both parties negatively, and until we get campaign finance reform and election reform, 3rd parties don't stand a chance."

Those safety nets are dependent on that person not working. If they get a job they no longer qualify.

No.  Did Pence and Biden know classified documents were sent to their offices and homes? No.  Is there a significant process gap that any elected official, cabinet member, senator could have given this process gap?  Yes.  Are they ultimately responsible? Yes.

Being forced to pay that much hourly (unless it\u2019s in a state that\u2019s already that expensive anyway), could cause the business to go bankrupt.

The vast majority of states are around $15-17 which is why I said $15 might have been a bit high at the beginning, pry closer to ~$10-12 but it absolutely isn\u2019t right now.\n\nThis does not allow for time off, this does not allow for vacations or frequent dining out, this does not allow for anything but standard rent, utilities, food, gas, etc\u2026 for a single person (not talking 2 cars, or a 3 bedroom house, or having kids, etc\u2026) just a single person living alone in a single bedroom or studio with basic necessities.\n\nThere is nowhere in the country where $15 is too much that is why it is needed federally. \n\nI already mentioned that other arguments about other careers making similar wages, but in terms of new small business I see no issue. If your business idea can\u2019t pay workers a livable wage your idea doesn\u2019t deserve to exist and fails the economic test just like any other business which fails to turn a profit and eventually fails.

You can reasonably claim it's a lot of things, many with negative connotations, but calling it fan fiction (to attach the negative connotations of that genre) is just really a bridge too far.\n\nFan fiction doesn't take it's inspirations to lend legitimacy to the work. Indeed the hall mark is using the inspiring work as a jumping off point to make specifically non-canon stories. You use that jumping off point to get established fans of the work engaging and then are allowed to run pretty wild, but I wouldn't call that \"lending legitimacy\" as much as \"playing on brand recognition\". Whatever else the story of the Magi may be, I'd argue it's not playing on the brand recognition of Zoroastrianism even if one can point to clear Zoroastrian influences. And influence is a key word, and it's a far cry from \"stealing other culture's ideologies and stories\", as if the writers don't have their own culture and ideology so clearly coming through the writing."

I like the point about a Tandy PC, and it's a point well taken, but again I contrast with the other references in Matthew to Old Testament prophecies. The book of Matthew is certainly trying to claim some legitimacy, but it's also incredibly specific and up front in how the author is trying to do it, even when it assumes that the reader is familiar with the prophecies. The magi being Zoroastrians is at best an easter egg.\n\nI'm not going to argue that Christianity hasn't engaged in a whole bunch of syncretism or cultural appropriation, but those things aren't fan fiction. You could say they're worse. All I'm saying is that they aren't the *same* thing as fan fiction.\n\nI'm also not arguing that the Bible doesn't draw inspiration from other cultures or religions.\n\nLiterally all I'm arguing is that fan fiction is a specific genre with specific hallmarks that help classify something as fan fiction, and no book in the Bible really has any of those hallmarks.

Politics tends to attract extreme opinions (from either side) and you wouldn't like some of the extreme opinions on the R side in those rooms. \n\nLiberals are restricted from speech in some situations too, it just looks a lot different. Yes, if someone has a history of being sexist, racist, said a bad word (or even accused of it potentially), (most likely liberal) students or parents might get together and make administration reconsider hosting someone them (as customers) don't want in a business they are frequenting (the university). Is it right? I don't know. That's hard. Free speech vs words actually hurting people. It's a very complicated discussion, please let's not. And it is important to note that most of these people with these kinds of -ist (or rumored or appearing, I'm trying to be generous) histories are Republican, so this will affect them disproportionately. This is a logically sound opinion though, that there should be more room for more people to speak. I guess you can say we can agree to disagree on this one or I see where you're coming from to some degree? But it's a complicated issue, let's not. Another major concern is liability for the university in hosting a speaker that may incite bad behavior or even violence. People preaching recycling or access to education or volunteering for the Peace Corps at a university don't tend do do this (yes, I know you have a quote from somebody or a news article of a couple, no need to share, I'm aware) where people speaking anti lgbtq may. I'm being very careful to not say Rs do violent speach and Ds do good speach. But you have to see these types of speaches are divided pretty neatly along party lines. \n\nBut Democrats or liberal speakers run into issues with free speech too. Again, it just looks very different. Look up Kent State. Look up what happened to Martin Luthor King Jr. I mean, these are extreme, but it's what I had off the top of my head for \"show me proof of liberal speakers getting targeted for speech\". I'm sure there are others. PETA is a liberal leaning organization that gets into a lot of trouble for stunts. I'm not going to pull up anything specific.\n\nBut Republicans do speak and often!

It doesn't relate here.\n\nIt's good that you haven't met them. They're insufferable people! \n\nBut regardless of how the conservatives you meet act, their vote gives Republicans power to continue their various fights against lgbtq rights. And maybe that's the right call for them or you (you haven't said how you vote, you don't need to, it doesn't matter). Republicans, as I've mentioned, are against business safety regulations and this leads to lower costs for manufacturing and are different (not necessarily better or worse for the sake of this argument) than Democrats in many of the ways they legislate. Maybe they're manufacturers. I don't want to say one party is right, just provide the facts. If Republicans fit with them on 5 issues that are important to them but they disagree on lgbtq rights, maybe they still need to vote R. \n\nBut do the math. Fighting lgbtq rights is a big deal for many Republican politicians. And has been for decades (you really need to check out those voting logs!). Why? They do this because it appeals to their voters. So the voters have to be out there. Yes, there are certainly some politicians who it's important to personally that domestic partners can't share benefits. But generally things like that are voted along party lines. Republicans in power keep their power, in part, because of the volume of support they get from anti lgbtq voters. There's even rallies and stuff of them. Decent sized crowds sometimes. They get out there with \"GOD HATES (various mean words for gay people)\" signs and everything. It's a big deal, both to them and the politicians hearing what their voters want. \n\nSo you should look into that too since you seem to be unfamiliar. The country is HUGE and I'm glad where you're from seems more civilized than some areas. But they exist and they vote. And they write letters. And they donate. \n\nIt sounds like it'd do you some good to become more familiar w the country demographically and the various people that make us up. There's a whole lot of people different than you. I'd say most of them are different than you pretty dramatically (and different from me, not trying to make a dig at you). Saying that you haven't seen people of a certain type around you as part of your argument belays that this is probably something you need a more national understanding on if you'd like to discuss it at this level.\n\nOtherwise, great.

And republicans can do this too when they have the majority. It isn't just Dems: \n\n>In open session, the Senate parliamentarian would formally advise the chamber\u2019s presiding chair, Vice President Joe Biden or his designated stand-in, that 67 votes are needed for a rule change.\n\n>The presiding chair would echo the parliamentarian\u2019s finding, prompting Reid to move to overrule the chair and propose that all rules changes could be done with just 51 votes. Senate procedure permits most matters, including overruling the chair, to be decided by a simple majority.\n\n>Democrats would then change the rules again, this time to reduce to 51 from 60 the number of votes needed to end filibusters against judicial and executive branch nominees.\n\n>Democratic aides say Reid is considering only changing the rule on filibusters for nominations, not legislation. But once a precedent is set, both sides note, it could be extended.\n\nSo when you see democrats crying and complaining about a filibuster, just know that they can and have gone around it before.

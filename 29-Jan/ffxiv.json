I specifically stated what I was using, and acknowledged its anecdotal nature by asking if you could provide more solid data.\n\nOn the opposite side, you yourself have made a lot of anecdotal assumptions, not the least of which being the size and contents of my personal analysis. Where I asked questions, you declared yourself correct. Where I have been trying to have a discussion, you have been trying to be right.\n\nBy definition, the average player would have an average understanding of the most integral game concepts. This generally does not include the concepts of skill floor/ceiling in most games, but especially in a game as casual-friendly as 14. Also taking into account the worldwide nature of the game, and its relatively recent popularity surge since Endwalker, I wouldn't discount the likelihood that a large number of players have never heard of the concepts at all.\n\nThis is where I'm leaving off here, as I don't feel like there was even much point to this post, judging by the one I'm replying to."

This is prob one of the best examples how to do movement properly as Missle Front #1 as simple as possible using 1st puddle drop under Omega, this puts you closer to ring for 2nd puddle position, and also creating space for party behind you as visibly shown in clip.\n\nWe wiped due to people still getting comfortable with Movement, considering this is PF, i'm there helping people get pulls so they get comfortable with it.\n\nIt's pretty common to fail any mechanic as pf group in PF during Week 1 of release, esp. an Ultimate one of the hardest Newest content in the game. Not everyone has had months to do this mechanic let alone a even a day, so odds of failing is higher at the moment. There was Fresh prog people who i let in this party to experience P1, fact is the person who was fresh was able to understand this strat and seen most of P1 with guidance within short time.\n\nIt was same thing when I was doing DSR week 1 in PF.

If you want to adjust it for me, feel free to do so.\n\nThe only example, i said you have to be at that spot is for Panto movement, which has to follow these rules and spots. I typed that out purposefully in it's own section of the picture, because if you go where ever you want to go, you will likely wipe the group.\n\nOne of the biggest reason i decided to put a Dot in front of Melees and Tanks, because they generally in melee range, while healers and range usually in back row, i thought it made more sense if you don't think that makes sense, then okay! Nothing i can do about that interpretation, but at least i explained it now, Plus i didn't want to put dot right on Letters and Number Waymarks."

Would standard be better then if I were to play long term? So I would get the 180 days subscription for $13?

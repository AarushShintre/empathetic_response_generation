You don't have to watch the border at all times because those lives are recorded and you don't have to watch it because there are other ways of getting information, like for example sources which redactors are using in articles.

Redactors writing for defense sites. They could have sources in Poland, they could have sources in Ukraine, I don't know, but you didn't belive that 54 Krab were given to Ukraine which turned out to be true and now you don't belive that there could be more than that. I guess we will see won't we?\n\nAnd for Twardy I don't understand why do people not belive Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine when he literally writes that they received them. Again why the fuck would he be lying?! Even the spokesperson of Agencja Uzbrojenia confirmed it but still \"no that can't be true, because I don't feel like it is\".

Your article doesn't mention hiding of treatment, but let's just assume it's true, because that aspect is plausible. We're talking about State actors here. \n\nA few facts:\n\nIsrael is full of Muslim doctors for a start. Israeli hospitals have thousands of Muslims on staff.\n\nSyrians aren't necessarily Muslim. 10% are Christian, 3% are Jewish or Atheist. The remaining that are Muslims are divided by sect, so they don't even have the same beliefs as other Muslims (like the difference between Catholics and Southern Baptists, and even as much in some cases as Mormons).\n\nIf Israel is hiding treatment, it's because Israel is at war with Syria and has been, technically, since 1948. Imagine if the Ukraine war petered out to unending but low key conflict for the next 75 years. Now imagine after all that time, a Ukrainian family travelled to Russia for medical treatment. They don't want their Ukrainian family to know that. The religion isn't the issue, it's the baggage that goes with 75 years of being at war with your neighbor. Israel bombs Syria to this day. Do they deserve it? I don't know, maybe sometimes in some cases.\n\nPeople think the ME conflict is all religion. It's close but not quite. It's worse than that. It's about the Arab nations believing that they were colonised by Europeans. These religions all get on way better than they make out, but Euro culture Vs ME culture? That's been a long time getting there."

      "body": "Israel treats Muslim fighters in secret, yes or no? An answer please lol? Anyway I don\u2019t think you can answer it but below are quotes re what you wanted. \n\nTwo Syrian patients shared their experiences in Syria and Israel with The Associated Press as soldiers from the Israeli military supervised. The two spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear they or their families would be targeted in Syria if their stay in Israel is made public.\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-syria-assad-treating-airstrikes-military-wounded-injured-war-a7673771.html\n\nZiv\u2019s staff members worry that, after returning home, their Syrian patients will be targeted because they received medical care in Israel. \n\nThe patients have returned to Syria, for the most part. Some have been harmed upon return to Syria. Children tend to want to go back to Syria after they are treated. Because people in Syria dislike Israel, discharge letters must be written in English without the hospital letterhead.\n\nNasser\u2019s road to recovery remains long, but he does worry about going home. He\u2019s heard the stories of Syrians who have been attacked for seeking treatment in Israel. Yet, he does want to go back to his village. \n\nWhen he regained consciousness, he said, he found himself in a Coca-Cola truck with six other injured Syrians. It was nighttime.\n\n\"If we were to put the lights on, we knew the army would chase us and kill us all,\" said the patient, who did not give his name for fear of reprisals if he were to be identified as being in Israel.\n\n\u201cEvery wounded Syrian is guarded by either an IDF soldier or by a civilian security guard in an attempt to isolate them from speaking with anyone unauthorized to do so who might photograph them or pass on their information to Syria, potentially harming them or their families upon their eventual return to Syria.\u201d\n\nEdit: how crazy is it that you can\u2019t even admit that Muslims are treated in secret? I mean I wish I smoked so I could partake in whatever sauce you\u2019re on."

On top of that, \u201cthe number of growing NGO roles\u201d none of that is legion related. \n\nThe legion ONLY takes people with war experience, except if they know them and find them valuable.  Some of our humanitarian volunteers have after 6-8 months been invited to join the training and moved onto the legion.\n\nBut I have 10 volunteers every day asking me if they can join the legion but have no war experience.  When I explain to them that is more likely they go get rejected and move to humanitarian roles if they are lucky or become homeless if they are unlucky (has happened to a few) most say no, they just wanna go fight.\n\nAnd then go, get a job hoping that they will somehow make it into the army or legion and end up not getting it.  Kicked out of humanitarian teams because they finally get that this volunteer is seeking glory, and we do not need them in the humanitarian sector. \n\nI only managed to place one in the legion, because he had been volunteering for 6-8 months in a humanitarian role before, and he had a degree in intelligence from the most proficient military school in the world.  And it took us 2!!! Months.  I couldn\u2019t do it, but he did by meeting them and then helping them around a bit.  \n\nSo don\u2019t think is all that easy.  It was in March, but not anymore! Specially since there were 20.000 volunteers registered waiting for weapons to fight in April.  They had to become a lot more selective.\n\nBut please, BY NO MEANS ARE ARMED DUTY IN THE LEGION AND HUMANITARIAN WORK INTEREXCHANGEABLE.\n\nIf you or anyone you know is former military and wants to HELP.  Truly HELP you can join a humanitarian mission evacuating civilians, delivering aid, or de-mining.   \n\nPlease reach out to me if you are interested!"

ONLY INTERNATIONALS, in April.  \n\nI know because I was asked if I could somehow source them weapons. \n\nI also know the Parliament deputy and the one of the military men who where in charge of putting in place the new requirements for the legionnaires.  \n\nTrust me, even with military training, if you have not got war experience you will NOT enter the legion unless you have been delivering aid for them or with them for a few months and they know you and respect you.  Then you are allowed to do the physical and psychological test.  Then you are allowed to do the training.  And THEN maybe you get a placement, maybe you get a menial job. \n\nBECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT GOT ENOUGH WEAPONS.  \n\nAnd the army neglects them entirely.   Everything the legion gets is donated to them, because the army gives them nothing.\n\nBut also, DO NOT CONFLATE HUMANITARIAN WORK WITH LEGION DUTY.  TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS. \n\nTo start, many people just wanna hold a weapon and play CoD real life.  \n\nTo follow we have no requirements other than military training for some of the roles but they are NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEGION. The visa is different, the support is different, and there is no pot of gold at the end of it.  You also do not get to hold a weapon, and many times we advice to NOT GO TOO CLOSE TO THE WARZONE because nobody wins if you get kidnapped.\n\nThere have been many roles for non military since the start of the war! We were doing evacs of civilians, orphans, demining, aid delivery from week 1.   \n\nIt is recommended that you have 1000USD per month to do this type of work which is why many aren\u2019t interested.  They think the legion is funded and they will be cared for there,  true they get roof and some food, but there\u2019s no stipend. WE GET THEM CLOTHES BOOTS AND EVEN SOME FOOD from our humanitarian work.  But I would still recommend them to have 250usd a month pocket money, and an clear exit plan.  With SP4UA posts you will be able to tell that a ton of volunteer fighters come out without even tickets back home, or a care plan. \n\nSo many misconceptions in your post i hope this clarifies some!"

Some of them have been professional soldiers, some have served in readiness units and others have only went through the regular conscription service \u2013 yet the common theme is no combat experience before the war. There have been probably some who have participated for example in the ISAF mission and thus have had, if not outright combat experience, at least experience operating in a high risk environment. However, the problem is that many of those are middle-aged men with wives and families by now so it is not that easy to pack your stuff and leave.\n\nI don't mean anyone can just show at the border, they are immediately given weapons and thrown into combat but eventually they seem to find themselves performing combat duties if they so desire \u2013 and obviously find a team that wants them along.

Maybe you can answer me? :)\n\nOften, when I read english translations of slavic languages, the translations are fragmented and doesn't really make sense together. In this case, the english translation mentions \"when the defenders of Ukraine did not have enough ammunition\", which isn't really that relevant to the fact that bulletproof wests were made from car springs. Is this a case of the Ukrainian word for \"ammunition\" also meaning \"supplies\" or \"equipment\" or something similar that could explain why there was a need for making vests, or is it a correct translation in terms of the seemingly unrelated statements on not having enough ammunition and manufacturing vests from springs?"

You need to translate into your native tongue and not the other direction to make a good translation.  Translation is a real skill.\n\nThe issue is not to do with Slavic languages themselves.  It is very common across the world and often can be found in very prominent places.  A favourite of mine was a huge sign at the Eiffel tower with garbled English https://i.redd.it/glr0wa1xc6181.jpg  This sign will have cost thousands of euro and no-one bothered to check it past an English speaker.  No-one would use the phrase 'painting and stripping' you'd just say repainting or similar.\n\nWords are complicated - English is also hard because the same word can mean different things in different versions of English eg a vest is a different thing in the UK than in the US."

I recently watched a video translated from French to English.  It was about flight MH370 but they kept translating \"vol\" as \"steal\" rather than \"flight\" because in French the word can mean either and they chose the wrong one.\n\nYou see similar things in Ukrainian translations like \"cistern\" being used instead of tanker I've seen several times.\n\nI suspect you notice with Ukrainian because you are not used to Ukrainian's English.  The French for example make consistent errors in English but they think these errors are correct because they are so used to French English.  So words like \"splitted\" are often used.  I used to work in a French (\"English\" speaking company)\n\nIt may also be that you are just used to countries where people have very good English due to the amount of influence the language has, music/film/books/education etc\n\nBut I suspect English is not your first language but you are very good at it.\n."

You're just guessing, and it's pretty obvious. These Ukrainian fighter jet pilots don't have to be turned into the best pilots on the face of the earth. They will be trained in the United States and will receive the world's best training, and six to seven months will be more than adequate. Stop talking like a fighter pilot needs five years of training on an F-16 to control the thing FFS. These Ukrainian pilots already have years of experience. \n\nNow, if it were Romania training these pilots, it probably would take years because Romanians are idiots. But they are being trained by American trainers, the best in the world. 6-7 months tops for excellent MIG fighter jet pilots to become excellent F-16 fighter pilots. \n\nWhy do you Europeans always talk when you know nothing and never studied any of this stuff? You don't even have access to academic journal articles so all your information comes from garbage sources. Maybe don't comment on things you know nothing about and have never studied for five minutes in the past?"

Although for weeks the \u201cLet's free the Leopards\u201d campaign has been putting pressure \u2013 together (and for much longer) with the Ukrainian president \u2013 to convince Berlin to send its Leopard 2s to Ukraine, the German government is resisting.  \n>  \n>Ukraine and Russia at the end of the first year of war, with already over \u00bc million dead, wounded and missing, are preparing for what will inevitably happen in 2023, i.e. a further escalation. On the one hand, new weapon systems have been amassing for several months including, for example, the T-90M: modern tanks with active protection systems, which will raise and exacerbate the confrontation on the ground battlefield (therefore they cannot be plus funds from anti-tank warehouses to worry dated \u2013 albeit updated \u2013 Soviet-era vehicles such as the T-72 B3M). On the other hand, advanced systems continue to arrive \u2013 such as Patriot anti-aircraft / anti-missile missiles \u2013 which however require lengthy training (in progress).  \n>  \n>The question we should ask ourselves is the following: why, faced with the lack of German generosity, do we not show all our Latin heart by doing our part?  \n>  \n>Last year our chief of defense staff, in the usual \u201cuseful\u2026 interview\u201d with *Repubblica* answered the question \u201cdo we have almost 200 tanks?\u201d confirming the data and adding the intention to update them (remember: about 1 billion euros from Italian taxpayers for only 125 tanks).  \n>  \n>Well, why not send our Ariete tanks? We can say with certainty that \u2013 keeping for ourselves a quota\u2026 let's say 30/40 vehicles \u2013 the current capacity of the national heavy components would not decrease by a comma.  \n>  \n>And that billion? We will have to resign ourselves to buying the state of the art \u2013 German, Israeli or Polish/South Korean \u2013 at the same price...  \n>  \n>Will someone in Parliament propose the addition of the Ariete in the next aid package?"

Secondly, the Swiss constitution, while calling the confederation neutral, does not define the term either. Accordingly, it's prudent to assume that neutrality only concerns direct and indirect interference in an armed conflict among third states.\n\nSanctions and embargoes are therefore seen not as neutrality or defence policies, but as economic policies, reason for which they are governed by separate constitutional clauses and legislative acts. \n\nI'm sure we agree that the boundaries between the two concepts are fuzzy at best and maybe not there at all. So while Switzerland does definitely not actively or passively partake in the war, it does sanction Ruzzia heavily (just like the EU) and Ruzzia obviously says that Switzerland is no longer neutral (as do some right wingers here).\n\nDue to this dilemma, Switzerland always employed a careful approach when pronouncing sanctions and embargoes. It would - and largely still does - only apply sanctions issued by the U.N. It does have the legal means to autonomously take over sanctions issued by the EU but normally doesn't or only takes over some. It's an absolute first that a Swiss government would take over all-encompassing and very far reaching sanctions packages from the EU."

Given that, I imagine they don\u2019t have readily available Abrams that they\u2019re willing to sacrifice for this. \n\nAnother factor can be simply that it takes an administrative direction to either fast track production or use existing stocks, and that direction just hasn\u2019t been given yet. \n\n10,000 Abrams worldwide doesn\u2019t translate into 10,000 modern, serviceable Abrams that the US has access to."

At SP4U we have worked with dozens of foreign military and humanitarian volunteers who left Ukraine and struggled with the transition home. It has been hard to watch.\n\nWe put together a program with a curriculum designed by a social worker who works with American veterans and has counseled dozens of veterans returning from Ukraine. It is also guided by the experiences of one Army veteran who fought in Ukraine for 9 months and is also a trained counselor. \n\nThey need the rest of us to step in and make sure they can participate in this program. It costs $250 to Adopt a Volunteer and fund their whole participation in the program. If you Adopt a Volunteer, you have a chance to write them a letter about what their service means to you and we will also give them your email at the end of the program and many will reach out to say thank you (this part is optional).\n\nTo learn more, go to [sp4ukraine.org](https://sp4ukraine.org) and click on the Adopt a Volunteer program.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions you have."

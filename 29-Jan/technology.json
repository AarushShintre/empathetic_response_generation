He just opened that up to the world now.\n\n\n\nPutin's whole life is messing with the west and bratva deals [all the way back to Ozero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozero) and [LLCInvest](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/20/russian-emails-vladimir-putin-llcinvest).\n\n[Putin and Sobchak takeover started in 90s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin#1990%E2%80%931996:_Saint_Petersburg_administration). \n\n> In May 1990, Putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to the mayor of Leningrad Anatoly Sobchak. In a 2017 interview with Oliver Stone, Putin said that he resigned from the KGB in 1991, following the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev, as he did not agree with what had happened and did not want to be part of the intelligence in the new administration. (sure buddy...)\n\nPutin would later [kill his mentor on his first campaign, he had a heart attack and his two guards all had symptoms of poisoning just randomly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Sobchak#Death).\n\n> On 17 February 2000, Putin met with Sobchak and urged him to travel to Kaliningrad to support his election campaign. Sobchak traveled there, accompanied by two assistants who also served as his bodyguards. On 20 February 2000, Sobchak died suddenly in the town of Svetlogorsk of the Kaliningrad Oblast. The initial suspected cause of death was a heart attack, but the findings of two medical experts were contradictory. A criminal investigation of Sobchak's death as a possible \"premeditated murder with aggravating circumstances\" was opened only on 6 May 2000, more than two months later. After three months, the investigation was closed without a finding. The Democratic Union party led by Valeria Novodvorskaya made an official statement that not only Sobchak, but also two of his aides had heart attacks simultaneously, which indicated poisoning. Two other men were present with Sobchak during his death, but their names were not publicly disclosed\n\n> According to an independent investigation by Arkady Vaksberg, both bodyguards of Sobchak were treated for symptoms of poisoning after Sobchak's death, indicating a probable contract killing by poisoning. Sobchak's widow Lyudmila had her own autopsy done on her husband's body, but never made the results public; she told the BBC that she keeps the findings in a secure location outside Russia.\n\nFrom the beginning Putin had access to transfer of state funds and foreign investments.\n\n> On 28 June 1991, he became head of the Committee for External Relations of the Mayor's Office, with responsibility for promoting international relations and foreign investments and registering business ventures. Within a year, Putin was investigated by the city legislative council led by Marina Salye. It was concluded that he had understated prices and permitted the export of metals valued at $93 million in exchange for foreign food aid that never arrived. Despite the investigators' recommendation that Putin be fired, Putin remained head of the Committee for External Relations until 1996.\n\nYou do know that Yeltsin basically put in Putin. Putin was always going to get it as the Saint Petersburg [Sobchak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Sobchak) wing was taking over, they needed the initial leader to appear to be aloof and weakened. Yeltsin essentially put in Putin at midnight 2000. The television announcement is almost like a hostage situation.\n\n**[Putin was in charge of the transfer of wealth from the USSR to the Russian Federation, it was here the bratva built up essentially a Kings Court of oligarchs in the new tsardom/mafia state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin#1996%E2%80%931999:_Early_Moscow_career)**.\n\n> Putin, who had led his election campaign, resigned from his positions in the city administration. He moved to Moscow and was **appointed as deputy chief of the Presidential Property Management Department headed by Pavel Borodin. He occupied this position until March 1997. He was responsible for the foreign property of the state and organized the transfer of the former assets of the Soviet Union and the CPSU to the Russian Federation**.\n\n> On 26 March 1997, President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin deputy chief of the Presidential Staff, a post which he retained until May 1998, and chief of the Main Control Directorate of the Presidential Property Management Department (until June 1998). His predecessor in this position was Alexei Kudrin and his successor was Nikolai Patrushev, both future prominent politicians and Putin's associates. On 3 April 1997, Putin was promoted to 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation \u2014 the highest federal state civilian service rank. \n\n> Putin as FSB director, 1998. On 25 July 1998, Yeltsin appointed Putin director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the primary intelligence and security organization of the Russian Federation and the successor to the KGB.\n\n\nPutin demanded the use of half the wealth in the Putin Purge just like MBS in the Saudi purge of 2017 and Xi early in 2012+. \n\nDeal with your wannabe tsarist then maybe you'll get a clearer picture."

It's enough that if you increase that 100,000 iteration much you'll find your own computer slowing down when trying to unlock your vault and your mobile devices using Bitwarden or other password managerwill slow as they unlock it too even at the 100,000 iteration. \n\nSo whilst longer is better there comes a point in the cost:benefit ratio where you're already at a point it's going to take so long to decrypt the data will already be worthless by the time someone manages to do it.  Basically as a private individual if it takes 100 years to it'll have managed to stay safe longer than you'll live and once you're dead you won't care so that's good enough for most cases and anything beyond that is wasted energy, time and money."

From what I've learned, when it comes to iteration counts like these, it's also super effective when also paired with a good salting strategy. i.e. Each hash should have a totally random and unique salt. \n\nI know it sorta goes without saying, but a weakness in that is that if it's common to hash 100k times than you can easily just build rainbow tables to attack common passwords and then apply that to multiple users, multiple services, etc (just depending on how they hashed things). I'm super rusty on that knowledge and extraordinarily out of practice, so that's just pure academic information still in my noggin, so... take with a grain of sea salt."

Claiming that ML algorithms are more in common with Google than not is quite a stretch though, and that's the part that people (at least myself) find odd. There's a pretty significant difference between a database that just memorizes information to be retrieved and one that learns a general representation instead of memorizing inputs. That nuance is what my responses wanted to clarify.\n\n> lol. Classic \"expert\" move to deny the obvious when cornered. Because ego.\n\nIt's not because \"ego,\" it's because I'm genuinely unqualified to tell you how our brain works. It would be \"ego\" if I tried to tell you that I knew everything about them. I'm sure you can agree that brains are complex, nuanced things. I don't know enough about it to talk about it as if I'm knowledgeable. I can certainly agree that our brains store retrievable data, so they have some properties of a database, but they're also obviously more complicated than that.\n\n> double lol\n\nNo, genuinely every academic I've worked with has shared the same opinion. They were *inspired* by the brain, but they don't really work like the brain does. I'm not sure where you're getting your views from, but they do not reflect that of the field you're talking about. Brains are crazy advanced compared to the things that we design.\n\nFor another example, take learning how to write. We first learn about language, going from letters to words to sentences. We learn about grammar and how to structure our words. Using all of these building blocks we can then write coherent essays.\n\nAs you probably know, a language model does not do this at all. It's the equivalent of us giving a toddler a pile of books and asking them to read through them and figure out how to write an essay.\n\nSo yeah, neural networks and other deep learning models don't really try to replicate the brain, they work very differently."

The US does not because (I am repeating myself) the distributed authority and funding model.\n\nThe BART system is good.

There are too many cities in America with exceedingly poor transit, such as Seattle in comparison. America should do better.\n3. And Tokyo isn't distributed? It notably does not have a unified subway system. Taipei has an incredible amount of districts where each subway line goes through, far more than any US city, yet there's one of the best subway systems in the world even though Taiwan is infamous for fighting in legislature and hate among divided groups because, you know, massacres, past authoritarianism, second longest period of martial law, climbing out of a kleptocracy.\n\nI think the BART system is just okay. It is not sufficient. Japan has bullet trains but bullet trains are for traveling between cities and not so much within.\n\nAll in all, I agree with your latter statement, except I don't think it necessarily requires an amendment to the constitution. I do think, however, there needs to be a cultural expectation that US politicians serve Americans and more Americans be aware that American CAN and COULD and SHOULD have the best transit systems in the world, if only they demand their politicians deliver at the voting booth.

However, this died because of lack of political backing.\n\nBART is a light rail and bus system - Bay Area Regional Transit.  No run is long enough to justify a bullet train.  Caltrain is the service between cities, and these runs are less than 100 miles.  Green, cheap, and reliable.  No comparison to a national system, but certainly comparable to a regional service.\n\nYou throw bombs without any idea how to move forward.  You list \"shoulds\" and \"coulds\" with no answer of how to actually address the problems.  Saying the electorate should do more will never happen.\n\nIf all you want to do is rip on the US without answers, you aren't arguing.  You're complaining.  The cost would be trillions, not billions.  The voting public has no appetite for this type of expense because of the impact of the people who get elected.  Unless we change the type of people elected to government with a constitutional amendment, we will never get to the trillion dollar investment level to have a national program for public transportation.  We could replace many regional flights with cleaner and cheaper bullet trains.  We could replace Amtrak with bullet trains for 1,000 mile runs along the coasts and from the coasts to sections of the interior. We could help cities reconfigure to support walking, bikes, and reliable and safe public transportation.  We won't until we change the government."

SFO still requires paper tickets for some idiotic reason. They charge $3 for a fucking Clipper card. Unlike most other developed nations BART doesn't have a clean public bathroom available at every single station, the fares are relatively expensive, it is dirty too, and unlike modern subway systems doesn't have proper bike support like in Japan, Taiwan, etc. It often is delayed, is incredibly loud, and the air conditioning and heating not up to par.

H-1B workers earn more on average than American workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree within the same age group and occupation. That is, they aren\u2019t earning less than American workers. The data doesn\u2019t support that. \n\nYou could argue some of these outsourcing companies like Tata exploit the system, but these are not even American companies to begin with. They\u2019re Indian. If they weren\u2019t able to hire people in the US, they\u2019d simply move back to their countries. I agree H-1Bs shouldn\u2019t go to outsourcing companies like Tata and Infosys, though, but then again I also dislike the whole idea of using contractors like they do. \n\nStill, immigration is what has allowed the US to have the leadership role it has in technology and innovation.

You don\u2019t work in tech if you seriously believe all SWE and ML roles, for example, can be filled with Americans. There aren\u2019t enough people who were born here and qualify for these roles. You either hire foreigners who have studied insanely hard and overworked themselves to learn these fields or you lose to foreign companies that can and will hire this talent. The US has been winning the tech and innovation war simply because it has a strong currency and the resources to hire whoever it wants. \n\nI disagree with H-1B for contracting companies not because I believe they game the system or whatever, but because I disagree with the concept of hiring foreigners to technically work for another company instead of your own. But, at the same time, American workers don\u2019t want to work for Tata or other Indian companies. They want to work for FAANG. And FAANG don\u2019t contract with Tata for decent roles.

For phramabro, daraprim was essential for all immuno-compromised individuals. \n\nSo in short the logic works one way, if something is essential in definition for your case, then whether they think you will die or not doesn't matter, you are legally given the option to take it.\n\nBut if something is not considered an essential medicine at the time, then anything happens is legal grounds for suits which can inturn have your medicines listed as essential for your condition for the future. \n\nRight now there is a well known executive order that is working on exactly that for covid affected.

This was done half a century ago:\n\nhttps://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co8452715/pruteen-sample-sample-synthetic-protein\n\nThe methanol there was made from natural gas, but it could be equally made from CO2 reacted with hydrogen produced by electrolysis.\n\n> Additionally, how many new agricultural projects are slated to begin on protected land?\n\nThat's not the point.  How much land could go back to wilderness if we weren't growing food on it?  You are arbitrarily ruling out the value of land converted back to wilderness in this fashion, privileging food production on existing land for no reason other than inertia.\n\nBut suppose we go along with that, and just stick with existing farmland and consider it usable for any purpose just because we're already using it.  Converting some of that farmland to PV collectors, and then allowing beef to become a bit more expensive (perhaps making some synthetic feed to compensate), would be a profitable thing to do -- the value of energy from PV on former agricultural land would be at least an order of magnitude higher than the value of the animal feed produced on that land.   Would you object to this?  If so, why?\n\n> You're the one claiming they're the same thing.\n\nIn economic analysis, we can trade X off against Y.  The tradeoff is based on the economic value of the activities.  If land in a wild state has value, it has value regardless of whether we were considering to use that land for farming or for solar energy collection (or for any other use.)\n\nThe central point here is that farming doesn't deliver all that much value per acre.   Why are you so hung up on preserving this, but objecting to the far more lucrative use of that land for PV?   Your position is hypocritical."

I said protected wild land shouldn't be being converted in the first place.\n\n> It has value whether we are considering to use that land for farming or for solar energy collection.\n\nSo...you're saying that what you just claimed isn't the point actually is the point. I'm not saying it's okay to put agricultural land on protected woodlands, but not solar farms, and I'm not saying that no land anywhere should be used for energy generation. I'm saying that protected lands shouldn't be being released from their protected status so they can be razed for solar farms when there are perfectly viable alternatives. Feel free to re-read what I said if you think that wasn't my point (although I stated it explicitly by saying I don't care if you want to build a 10 mi^2 solar farm in the mojave.)\n\nYou're trying to discredit my position by equating lands already in agricultural use with protected wetlands and woodlands. It is both a false equivalency and a strawman.\n\nYou keep trying to use economics to manipulate my opinion, but my point was never an economic point to begin with. My point is an environmental point. The environment should be preserved when it can reasonably be preserved, even if it's not the most economically viable option.\n\nIf there is a more reliable, albeit slightly more expensive way to produce the equivalent amount of beef at the equivalent rate to that which is already being produced on agricultural land that also requires the conversion of less wild land than conventional agricultural techniques, then I'll advocate fully for its use, provided that it's not being carried out on otherwise protected land."

Something Tesla has chosen to completely ignore (ISO 26262 and ASIL)"

The very ACT of widely rolling out experimental tech to consumers is the opposite of caution. Elons MO with testing anything be it Tesla vehicles, computers, or rockets is to fuck up and then ask for forgiveness. Which his army of dedicated fanboys happily provide."

Musk has stated they need many times the current number of miles driven before they feel it\u2019s ready to drive without driver attention. Until then, drivers are supposed to remain attentive, as drivers are normally supposed to do. But even then FSD has saved many people who fell asleep at the wheel.\n\nSpaceX did indeed blow up a lot of unmanned rockets to rapidly advance technology far beyond anyone else in the world. However, they slow way down when safety is involved, such as the design of the Crew Dragon. They\u2019ve also slowed way down with Starship because a full stack blowing up on the pad would set them back too far."

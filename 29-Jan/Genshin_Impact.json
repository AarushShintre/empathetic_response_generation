However, they're still subject to the erosion of their minds and souls. For Hilichurls, this is the reason they degenerate into primitive beasts, and eventually dissolve into the Abyss based on what we observe in the Chasm. \n\nDainsleif is still suffering erosion of his mind, and has lost a large portion of his memories. But he has access to some specific, unnamed thing that has allowed him to retain his sense of self. It's unknown whether this has a relation to the Abyss Order, or whether Pierro is in the same boat. \n\nThe Traveler, meanwhile, is immortal in a way that no one on Teyvat can attain. Unlike even Dragons and Gods on Teyvat, the Traveler doesn't erode. This is the reason that Zhongli wants them to witness the history of Teyvat: so that by carrying these memories across the stars, there will always be a record of their world."

We know that traveler slept for a long time upon first arriving in Teyvat and we know the sibling was at Khaenriah. \n\nMy memory is a bit hazy on the first Dain story quest but I recall Traveler being shocked at the implication their sibling has been alive for over 500 years.\n\nAll we know is that the people present at Khaenriah became immortal, we don't know how or why as far as in-game lore."

Zhongli is also sure that the Traveler will outlive this world and bring their memory of it with them as they travel to other worlds. \n\nAnd we know for a fact that the people of Khaenri'ah were cursed with immortality by the Gods. Dainsleif's entire Chasm questline deals with this, and the fact that many of the Hilichurls as well as members of the Abyss Order are what remain of his people."

Last time I tried a hypercarry team here, Pisslord was at 20% hp before he even used the shield.\n\nIf your hypercarry team doesn't have Zhongli, consider bringing Yun Jin (hold E oneshots the heads) or Ningguang, that fight doesn't require that much dodging.\n\nIf your hyperbloom team has Nahida, you can also strip it to its bare core (Raiden Nahida + hydro applicator) and put Ningguang on Prototype Amber into the last slot. This ensures that you can still deal damage to the boss while he's flying and take the shield down quickly. If no Nahida but you are using Xingqiu for hydro application, I suppose they would also deal enough damage to force the boss into the shield phase fast.\n\nIf it is of any help, [here's an example of hyperbloom + Ning that I ran a few days ago.](https://youtu.be/1RpoItg0Jh4?t=247)"

The only thing related to water in that scene lies on the water globe that is formed around them. After the globe is fully formed they become a Pilar of light and teleport while moving upwards, the initial point remains on the ground which implies that it works with coordinations, probably using the stars, it also implies that there is an end port to it, otherwise the stating point wouldn't remain.\n\nMore importantly, it explicitly shows that it's not based on spacial manipulation. A Wormhole would've been very appearent since it would look like a portal showing the end location through it. \n\nNow if you could not work with whay you were given, that's on you, but don't you came at me calling me a troll and saying that there is no info when you can easily infer a lot from what we were actually given."

Much like religion, where one cannot disprove the existence of divine entities.\n\nThey also believe that mountains and rivers are places where such veins can be found in abundance. \nAnyway the existence of this concept is part of what gave rise to Feng Shui.\n\nAnd unlike Ley lines, Feng Shui has found uses in specific sciences, despite being considered a pseudoscience.\nFor example it is actively used by some archeologists to find the location of ruins and other historical locations, it is used in botanical research and also in the study of asian architecture. \nIt's important to remember that Science has never discredited the existence of Earth's pulse as a concept. The only thing that happened is that no connection between the scientific method and these concepts have been found.\n\nPay close attention to this distinction because there are forces and energies that science still cannot observe, despite having seen evidence of their existence, which is the case of Dark matter and Dark energy. Which scientists are pretty sure they exist, but no machine or animal can detect it's presence. \nScientists only know about it because nothing else can justify some of the astronomical phenomenons that have been observed through all of the collected astronomical data collected from other star systems and galaxies"

And even if Klee is around 7-8, making bombs is way different than hosting an entire festival, especially when your mother is Alice."

      "body": "Ik you never said it, but i wanted to take it as a example that Ayaka can still Host things at a young age.\n\nBut i think making bombs are way harder than hosting an Festival. Since if a bomb explodes, you need to make a new one from zero. While at a Festival, you can get a replacement fast. Since Klee had also a thing that is more complex? Idk when it was but i think Klee called it her treasure (atleast in my language)."

      "body": "If you weren't saying I said that then why mention Hu Tao not ruining the business when my point was that Tao didn't have a choice to run it or not? Also the fact that you think that if a festival goes wrong, you just need to get a replacement is quite wrong. Like if Ayaka ruined the festival on accident, it would be a big talk between the locals and the Yashiro commission could get a lot of shit for it. Klee needs to remake a bomb from scratch, yes but there's not a big harm in accidentally getting it wrong, especially if Alice has shown her how to do it safely."

      "body": "I wanted to say with HuTao not ruining the business, that even teenagers/young people can do such things with Independence. I didnt mean the whole Festival would need a replacement. I meant when like the guy who makes food there, needs to say no (like three days before the Festival), since he doesnt have time. There would be many people in Inazuma, Ayaka can ask if they can take that Position over.\n\nAlso Ayaka can host a Festival at 16. In my school, every last-year classes (we dont have the us/uk system, so i cant really describe the school type) need to host their own prom. The last-year class of the third year school and five year-school (which are around 40 people, if we have full classes, but this year we are only around 30) need to host it.\nTwo people from each class, are like the chefs. They plan the decoration, how the tables look, etc. And there is only one teacher, who is only allowed to give us tips (like how they did it last year)\n\nWhile the rest of the class helps then building everything/decorating before the prom.\nAlso we need to sell tickets for other people. Because not only we go to it but also people from the city (and others) are allowed to go and have fun with us. \nThe third years are around 16-17. While the five years are around 18-19.\nLike, when we can do it. Why doesnt Ayaka can? \n\nAlso you see like the girl scouts selling their Cookies. Or some random child, sitting in their yard or something and selling lemonade or their old toys. \"But these are only small things\". Yes, but still they learn how to be sucessful/Independent at a young age. If you can sell Things at a age around 8-12 (or younger, i saw like 6 year olds selling their toys), then why cant Ayaka host a Festival at 16 (if shes the age)? Specially if she got teached to be Independent. Also in my country, you need to be atleast Independent in some things with 15. Because at 16, you get so many Options and Things where you dont need the allowance of your parents. You can do it on your own."

      "body": "I'm sorry but what? Again, Tao was forced to take over the business. She had no choice and she NEEDED to be careful with how she was running it. Also of course she didn't screw it up, I'm pretty sure Wangsheng Funeral Parlour is the only funeral parlour in Liyue Harbour atleast. Regardless of how crappy a company is, if they're the only company of a certain thing within a 10 mile radius, then you're 100% going to go to them. And also a class of 30-40 kids all working together is nothing compared to hosting a festival, neither is doing small things. I don't know how lowly you think of hosting a festival but like, if someone cancels 3 days before a festival then it won't be super easy to just replace them, like you need to make reservations and everything and if others in the city are busy then you'll need to look overseas or outside of the city (during the sakoku decree, you'd have to look outside of the city). That can be hard to do. If anything, and I mean anything, goes wrong you bring dishonor and shame upon your family, commission and yourself. You're making a festival ran by one person, with possibly a bit of help here and there, sound so simple as real life 18-19 year olds can do it but then say she's 16. She's never been said to be 16, and she's meant to be interpreted as a young adult, atleast 18. 16 is far too young to be hosting festivals and to be one of the faces for an entire commission and family.\n\nAlso, why are you comparing hosting a festival to selling toys or something, that's what you do at a festival, not when planning one?"

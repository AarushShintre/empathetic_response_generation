I've changed that out for a motherboard with built-in Wifi. Also changed to an X570 chipset. I changed your SSD from a 2TB unit to a 1TB unit (Samsung 980 Pro's are overpriced anyway).

You can see that it's quite complicated as it depends on speed, timings, ranks, Gear mode, etc. I can share more resources if you'd like to learn about it.\n\nLooking at current UK pricing, I would recommend any of these four kits: [https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/products/compare/Y9QcCJ,3q2WGX,hMLFf7,t6kWGX/](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/products/compare/Y9QcCJ,3q2WGX,hMLFf7,t6kWGX/) They are all good value, and they just happen to all be from Kingston. It just depends on if you want more CPU performance in anticipation for a future GPU upgrade."

However, for gaming, the 7700X is faster than anything, except the 13900K, when paired with 6000 DDR5, as you can see [here](https://www.techspot.com/review/2554-intel-core-i7-13700k/#12_Game_Average). \n\nIf you had lived close to a MicroCenter, I was going to pitch you the 7700X, as MicroCenter has some great combo deals on the 7700X, where they\u2019re basically giving you 32GB of 6000 DDR5 for free. \n\nSince MicroCenter is off the table, you can\u2019t do too much better for the cost than what you have in your list. I do have a couple of suggestions, though.\n1. For $4 more, get the faster memory below. \n2. A 550w PSU is all you need for an i5 with a 3060 Ti. Also, Corsair\u2019s RMe line of PSUs aren\u2019t quite as high quality as their RM or RMx lines. I\u2019m recommending a 650w PSU that\u2019s comparable in quality to the RMx line. 650w is enough to support a 3070 with the 13600K. In fact, if you switch to the 650w PSU, you could get the 3070, instead of the 3060 Ti, and still be under $1500 slightly. The 3070 will only be slightly faster than the 3060 Ti for video editing, but it will be about 10%-12% faster for gaming at 1440p.

Closer to the electrical panel the better.  \n\nIf the hall outlet is on a second breaker, this offers the advantage of doubling your wattage available.  It's likely on the same breaker thou.  You can check.  \n\nHonestly, I think you are overthinking this.  If the total circuit draw is below 1440 watts you are well within safe limits."

I cant see why a 5500 wouldnt be able to run faster than 3200mhz.\n\nThat being said is the speed boost over 3200mhz worth it? assuming big price differences probably not.\n\nEdit: just looked it up.   Officially max speed support is 3200mhz, it will support faster its just not guaranteed due to the differing potential of the IMC.  Same with any CPU.  One 5500 might support 4000mhz, the next one might only support 3800mhz."

I will test both games on 1440p right now\n\nIf you're not experiencing stutters in Read Dead then that could very well mean there's nothing wrong with your GPU and it could very well be the games you're playing.\n\nI just looked up the system requirements for Dead Space and saw that while the minimum requirements are a Ryzen 5 2600X/i5 8600 and RX 5700/GTX 1070, the recommended requirements are a Ryzen 5 5600X/i5 11600K and RTX 2070/RX 6700 XT.\n\nI also watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e-UnwC__1w) and in the first 5 minutes of the video the guy is literally saying things like, \"and through this door, here comes the fps drops\". Go to the 4:03 mark. \"And here comes the fps dip.\"\n\nAnd this guy is using a Ryzen 7 5800X and RTX 3080.\n\nStutters also take place throughout the video.\n\nThese are clear indicators of the game either one, being super demanding or two, not being well optimized. And this is something the developers will most likely try and roll out multiple updates to fix over time but if the game is super demanding in general then updates may or may not make things better.\n\n>So I just tried destiny 2 on 1440 and it was a lot better. A few stutters here and there but nowhere near as much\n\nDestiny 2 is an online game so maybe the stuttering in it is from playing with several people online? I am not sure.\n\nWhat fps are you getting? And what is your fps dipping to when you're experiencing the stutters?"

Also i have played 1800 hours of destiny on pc prior to owning this 6650xt using a 5700xt and I have never had an issue. Hence why I am quite confused. I normally get around 110fps depending on the maps. The game itself is very poorly optimised but like I said above I never had an issue before with the 5700xt. When I do get stutters it normally drops to around 90, though I have seen lower."

Things like shadow quality, anti-aliasing, reflections, etc, etc. Each game varies in what each graphic setting does to VRAM so you'll have to tweak and adjust manually to see what each setting does to VRAM usage, as well as frame rate, stutters and of course visual fidelity(how the game looks for you).\n\n>Also i have played 1800 hours of destiny on pc prior to owning this 6650xt using a 5700xt and I have never had an issue. Hence why I am quite confused. I normally get around 110fps depending on the maps. The game itself is very poorly optimised but like I said above I never had an issue before with the 5700xt. When I do get stutters it normally drops to around 90, though I have seen lower.\n\nIf Destiny 2 is very poorly optimized then that's most likely the culprit to the stutters. If you had a better experience with your RX 5700 XT in Destiny 2 then that could have something to do with how each GPU runs Destiny 2. Sometimes different GPUs can run games differently, no matter if they're better than one another or not. Tough to explain why.\n\nReason I asked about what fps you're getting and what it's dropping to is to give you a tip on fixing a specific type of fps drop. Stutters can be completely different than fps drops.\n\nIf you say you're getting 110 fps and stuttering causes your fps to drop to around 90, try capping your fps to 85 or 80 or 75 or 70.\n\nAnd while you're playing the game with your fps capped at 70 or 75 or whatever, do you then experience stutters? Or do you then experience your fps dropping from 70 to 35 or 45 or 50 or whatever? Or does it literally sit at 70 fps no matter what?"

As for Davinci, according to [Puget](https://www.pugetsystems.com/solutions/video-editing-workstations/davinci-resolve/hardware-recommendations/#:~:text=Dollar%2Dfor%2Ddollar%2C%20we,to%20using%20an%20AMD%20card.), they definitely prefer Nvidia over AMD. But it's worth noting that you can get a 6750XT for as low as $409 (in the US). For that same $409, the very best you're going to be able to do is a RTX 3060 12GB (which, in-fairness, you should be able to pickup for ~$350). \n\nThe question is, and I don't have the ability to answer this, is whether or not the 6750XT, being significantly faster than the 3060 12GB in gaming, is enough to also overcome the shortcoming in Davinci. Because Puget's benchmark did not include mid-range graphics cards, I'm unable to say whether or not AMD's upper-midrange is enough to overcome Nvidia's advantage there. \n\nBut as far as gaming, [the 6750XT is a no-brainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENUv23JVjqQ)."

At 1080p, it's likely that you'll experience a bottleneck with one of those. BUT, the question is whether or not it matters. The average framerate on the 8700 with a 6750XT should still be well-above 60. And at 4K, there's even less concern. \n\n> I also hear about amd is weaker in ray tracing\n\nYes... this is true. Again the question is whether or not it matters. We're not all that far into games that support Raytracing, and according to a survey I read recently, most of the time even when the game supports RT, it doesn't get turned on. Especially because it's a pretty massive performance hit, even on Nvidia cards, and in some games, [it's hard to tell if it's even on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4HkXEzzcRw). \n\n> If they have a 4060, I bet it will be a good choice if price is right\n\nWell there's the rub - Nvidia has made it clear that they have basically zero intention of making the price right. The GTX 1060 6GB, for instance, launched at a price of $249. The 3060 launched with an MSRP of $329, but good luck finding one for that price (they usually start at $350+). With the horrible prices of the 4000-series so far, I'd look for a price of at least $399, and as high as $499."

I run the BSD version but if you want to run docker you will want the newer Linux based flavor.\n\n3 - ZFS does raid (raidz) differently than standard RAID. I run my nas in raidz2, which gives me the ability to lose 2 of my (4) drives without data loss). The tl;dr is probably just pick the default if TrueNAS detects your disks properly.\n\n4 - You don't want to go too small on a NAS because HDD cooling is a serious issue (more than the CPU even). Whatever case you go with needs to have dedicated cooling for the drive bays. The number one cause of drive failures in my experience are them literally baking themselves to death.\n\nOther thoughts: \n\n* You will want ECC RAM if you care about this data. If this means buying 2 or 3 generation old used Xeon gear so be it.\n\n* DO NOT use external/USB HDDS if you care about this data. Shuck them if you have to but do not trust data you care about to USB HDDs.\n\n* You will also probably want one or more HBA cards rather than trying to find/pay a ton extra for a mobo with a ton of SATA ports. I think I paid like $30 for a LSI 9207-8i on fleabay.\n\n* I don't think you actually need to pay more for enterprise/NAS drives. My NAS has been chugging along on shucked drives for years and years now with no issues or failures. I replace the drives with bigger drives before they fail, and I'm pretty darn cheap (IE still running 4x 10tb drives).\n\n* Possibly controversial here, but I don't like running extra shit on my NAS. My NAS serves files and thats it. I have another (proxmox) box that handles hosting everything else. I trust TrueNAS and FreeBSD. I don't trust whatever randos made whatever docker images may end up on my machine. So that shit stays separate from my NAS. This is what you can use the NUC for.\n\n* A NAS is not a backup. You will still want to implement a proper 321 backup strategy. I do nightly encrypted backups to the cloud (TrueNAS has a wizard that sets it all up) and monthly local backups to external HDDs which are then stored offsite (at the inlaws)."

Never heard of this in my nerd-travels, but I've also never built a NAS before.  I presume with what little googling I did that this allows me to add more drives?\n* What is the relevance of the ECC RAM?\n* I have a habit of symlinking to my current drives from the NUC so that my home directory is really nothing more than symlinks to those drives.  Is there a downside to doing that with the NAS?\n* When calculating drives to buy, if I am going to raidz2 and want, say 40GB to do that, I then plan for, what, 8 10TB drives running raidz2?\n\nApologies for being so naive on this -- never built one and never considered building one until now.

Without getting too into the nitty gritty of it, for a variety of reasons despite having similar specs on the surface, a Samsung 970 Evo Plus will consistently perform at a higher level while also typically lasting much longer than a Teamgroup MP34 (which is a great value but relatively low end especially as a boot drive). It's decidedly more expensive, but in my opinion and experience it's worth it. And you should have plenty of room in your budget for a 2-4 TB HDD for large files and games (and ideally a full backup of your boot drive as an added layer of insurance against failure) if you want one as well though it's not mandatory. It's not as flashy necessarily as a better GPU, but to me storage is like PSU in that you should value bang for your buck but that ensuring that long-term performance, capacity, and stability needs are met are by far the most important factors in deciding what to get.\n\nNow, if you're willing to go right up to the $1500 cap which might be tough once you include sales tax on such a large set of expenses, you should be able to go 1TB 970 Evo Plus, 3TB HDD, *and* 6800 XT but the performance gain especially without further upgrading the CPU and probably Mobo would be minimal enough that I still wouldn't necessarily recommend spending the extra $100 there."

      "body": ">the Cpu gets up to almost 100% but the GPU is always at 40%\n\nThat sounds like you've got a lot of stuff running in the background. Earlier Intel (and yes, 9th gen is earlier at this point) wasn't as great at dividing tasks between cores. Hence why AMD was the far superior option for multi-core workloads even just a few years back. Intel has more of a tendency to work one core to the max before sending functions to another core. So if you're trying to run a game while also, say, web browsing with a lot of tabs or running background CPU tasks, it's gonna bog down the game a lot. I'd check Task Manager to see what exactly is eating up all the CPU resources. Because like you said, you *should* be getting better in-game performance \n\n>i wanted to use as much pieces of my current build into the new one, but it seems i have to get everythinng new T.T\n\nStuff like storage drives should port over just fine. But Intel is bad at dead-ending motherboards, and by going to a 13700K and 4080, you're getting a very high-power system that needs a PSU to match.   The Super Flower Leadex V or Corsair RM1000x would be good options"

Stability of ram OC goes down with 4 sticks for sure.  If it still gonna try to get more ram, two sticks will have more chance of being stable at overclock.  I still think the gains won't be worth the investment, but ram has dropped a lot recently, so might be worth a shot."

You'd likely have to spend a lot of money to move the performance bar any reasonable amount."

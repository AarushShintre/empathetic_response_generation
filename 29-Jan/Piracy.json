The IP addresses of those former domains therefore won't work.  I don't know of any other working public versions of ZLib in order to check their IP addresses.\n\nAnd you can't access a web site hosted within the Tor network using an IP address, since Tor is specifically designed to prevent identifying a user's location by their IP address.  But using Tor is as easy as not using Tor (since the Tor Browser is just a modified version of Firefox, and the \"New private window with Tor\" option in Brave is a built-in variant of private browsing in a fork of Chrome), so the best thing for ZLib's continued existence is for people to use the version of the site Zlib is providing via the means they're providing it."

The .onion links I provided are currently the only way to access Zlib.  You have to be using the Tor network to use a .onion link, and the easiest ways to use the Tor network are by using the Tor Browser or the \"New private window with Tor\" option in the Brave browser.    \n\nYou say you \"have tried the tor versions\" but then you say you haven't used the .onion links.  That's like saying you've looked for a product on Amazon but never used an electronic device.  The thing you said you didn't do is the way to do the thing you said you did do.\n\nIf you're saying you used the Tor Browser to access ZLib using one of the .onion links and weren't able to find anything, but haven't tried using the Brave browser, then you're out of luck.  The difference between using the Tor Browser and using the Brave browser is literally the difference between accessing a website using Firefox or Chrome.

Company laptop, personal internet. connect to a work VPN to develop/work on work shit.\n\nAbout 3-4 times a day I get a live notification that my devices location has been accessed by <certain software> that we use. I have no idea what that notification is *really* checking. I assume it\u2019s a snapshot type feature but anyway, the point is I don\u2019t know for sure.\n\nBut then you hear stories of ppl getting fired because the company grabbed the webcam recordings (that they are legally allowed to access, because you likely signed that away right when you signed a contract to work from home/allow monitoring software) and they see that the employee was not working when they said they were. \n\nThe important note here is, they were only motivated to access those recordings, because the employee did something stupid that motivated their IT department(or likely someone higher) to check in and see what the fuck happened.\n\nThis is a long way of saying. Assume everything you do on your computer is being logged and *can* be accessed *if necessary*"

Personally, I generally convert everything to EPUB since it's an open standard and slightly less likely to retain any social watermarking.  (Depending on how such watermarking might be done -- assuming it's even present at all -- this won't necessarily remove it, but I figure the further I can get the file from the original Amazon version the better off I'll be.)  When I add books back to the Kindle, Calibre automatically converts the books to MOBI, since my Kindle can't handle EPUBs."

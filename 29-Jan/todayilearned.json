Some nucleosynthesis (formation of atomic nuclei) did occur in the big bang, but only light elements, so hydrogen, helium, plus a little lithium and trace of beryllium were formed initially.\n\nOnce rapid initial expansion was finished and gravity could take over, stars began to form, and this is where many more elements else came from. Stars can create elements up to iron, depending on the size of the star and its age. Up to that point, adding to the size of an atomic nucleus increases the stability, which means it releases energy during the process. Beyond iron, formation of heavier elements absorbs energy instead of releasing it, so some of these elements form during the death of a small to medium star resulting in a supernova. That process only yields up to rubidium since it's not energetic enough and the resulting neutron capture is relatively slow. For really heavy elements, like gold, platinum, and uranium, you need really energetic events,  things like collisions with neutron stars. The basic mechanism for all the heavier than iron elements is neutron capture followed by conversion of a neutron to a proton by \u03b2- decay, but the range of elements that can be formed is limited by the energy of the neutrons involved. \n\nOur star is a third generation star, which is why the nebula it formed from had enough silicon, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, etc., to have planets and life. Without these elements, all derived from the ashes of earlier stars and various cataclysmic events, it would be a pretty boring place."

      "body": "First, you don\u2019t need to provide them. I\u2019m well aware. But I appreciate your smug condescension! I was a history teacher and literally taught US social and political history, including all the ways our government has and continues to fuck up. \n\nTo your point; \n\nThis is sort of a complicated question in legal terms. \n\nBy all means take them to court for any *extrajudicial* crimes they\u2019ve committed.\n\nI\u2019ll point out the US government is objectively more legitimate than the East German one though, and as a result it\u2019s harder to prosecute public officials when they act within the scope of their legal authority, since they\u2019re protected by sovereign immunity. I\u2019m not necessarily saying don\u2019t try, but you\u2019ll almost certainly lose the case on those grounds alone. This defense doesn\u2019t really apply in Honecker\u2019s case given he wasn\u2019t elected. He was essentially a soviet puppet. We\u2019re not talking about the leader of a state where rights like freedom of speech, thought, or the press aren\u2019t always *respected,* in East Germany they **didn\u2019t legally exist.** This guy was head of a government which literally shot its own citizens for trying to leave (AND HE\u2019S THE ONE WHO HAD THE IDEA). While I\u2019ll concede US elections aren\u2019t necessarily free or fair (especially where minority rights are concerned historically up to and including present day) there\u2019s still a vast distinction between an appointed de-facto dictator of a police state and an at-least sort-of-legitimately elected leader bound by due process and law. If you can prove any US official was acting beyond their legitimate authority when someone suffers a violation of their civil rights, they can (and should!) be prosecuted. I\u2019d also suggest that while you\u2019d have a stronger case for prosecuting US presidents the further back you go, certainly in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Act your case gets weaker and weaker, as more and more protections against state-sponsored and codified discrimination come online.\n\nHonecker was also being prosecuted for the extrajudicial crimes perpetrated by the state, especially the Stasi, when he was in charge (and as a result he bears final responsibility). I\u2019d encourage you to look into their activities, and ask whether there\u2019s any true American parallels. Again, I\u2019ll concede that US law enforcement has been incredibly selective with its enforcement of law against citizens (again targeting minorities), including through extrajudicial killings, especially (but not exclusively) in the days before civil rights (and id support prosecution in **any and all** of those instances!). Again, there are limited parallels between racist cops abusing black people and the massive surveillance apparatuses of the CIA and FBI, and the broad activities of Stasi, but these don\u2019t really compare in scale or in their institutionalization of violence with what the stasi were up to. Its comparing grapes to watermelons. They might both be fruits and shaped similarly, but there\u2019s a BIG difference. Many of those activities perpetrated by the CIA/FBI/Police also were, even at the time, still technically *illegal*, even if those laws weren\u2019t respected or properly enforced (they should have been). In *theory* in the US, even in the 1960s, you could prevail on an excessive force lawsuit against US police. Even trying to *file* that sort of thing in Honecker\u2019s East germany would probably get you thrown into a cell and beaten more, if not disappeared. To reiterate, if you can prove any US official is **directly culpable** for clear violations of civil rights and US law, lock em up!\n\nI\u2019ll also point out that because the US has certain protections of civil rights in place, this gives top officials some protection from culpability for the crimes their lower officers might inflict when those lower ranking individuals violate the law. To give you an example, you\u2019d have a hard time prosecuting Trump for the killing of Eric Garner or George Floyd, even if, as the head of government, he bears final responsibility for his governments actions because those killings were *violations* of US law. You can prosecute those cops, but their bosses (and their boss\u2019 bosses, all the way up to the President) will just claim that they certainly didn\u2019t endorse and aren\u2019t responsible for the actions of those individuals and that those actions violated departmental policy/state/federal law, and this is typically enough to secure them from liability (assuming the violation actually *was* illegal or against policy. If not, they\u2019re still likely on the hook). At a certain point, the government can say \u201cthat wasn\u2019t supposed to happen and it\u2019s not legal, so it\u2019s not our fault one guy broke the law and happens to work for us. We told him not to do it. It\u2019s (only) his fault. \u201d \n\nI\u2019ll also concede the US has done atrocious things to human beings all over the world, but there\u2019s (legally speaking) a huge difference in domestically prosecuting a state leader for what their dictatorship did to their own citizens as opposed to domestically prosecuting a democratically elected leader for the military\u2019s war crimes abroad. Again, not denying that going back to at least Korea, US leaders have been, at least in part, legally culpable for war crimes. But that\u2019s a matter for an international court and international law (which the Us will never submit to and isn\u2019t formally governed by). It\u2019s not the same as the people of a country prosecuting their own leader for what his government did to its own people, in violation of its own national laws. The point is US presidents weren\u2019t breaking any US laws *(debatably- depending on whether or not you view the entire military action an illegal use of force and beyond the lawful use of their authority, which I don\u2019t necessarily disagree with but which hasn\u2019t been conclusively decided in the courts)* when the military bombs Iraqi civilians or for what was done at Guantanamo, so you can\u2019t really prosecute them for that here, even *if* I think they should be. \n\nSo again, prove to me any US official is as legally culpable for the actions of their lower officials or has directly acted in ways which violate US law and civil rights, and I\u2019m all for prosecuting everyone responsible! No one should be above the law.\n\nHopefully this clears my position up."

Also, being a US history teacher, etc means nothing. My U.S history teacher loved Nixon, lol.\n\nHow exactly aware are you of the atrocities that the United States committed going on from the Korea-era forward? I did a little research on the Stasi since you posted this and I offer; what if I could prove that the CIA is worse than the Stasi? I simply offer it because I have no clue if you're going to simply ignore it or give it consideration. For example, I'm not sure if the Stasi ever explicitly experimented on children and dosing them with psychedelic drugs. Or permanently lobotomized people with those same drugs in experiments dedicated to disproving, which now sounds ridiculous, theories about \"mind control\" spurred on by fear of the Soviets.\n\nI mean what the U.S Army did in Korea alone would arguably top the charts in any capacity of the Stasi. It was so bad it created an entire hermit kingdom dedicated to fighting against the U.S because of the generational trauma from that event. Koreans didn't even have democracy until the 80s; the U.S was more than happy to support a dictator before then.\n\nThe U.S doesn't kill dictators. We support them. Chile and Allende, for example."

In theory, it could have be written that way, but in practice it was actually written from the top down after I picked up on something that was deeper than what I understood. I had figured out that if I could get data to track into cohesive patterns across the system (in this case the system being the human brain), I could guarantee fidelity in the concepts I was putting together. This would not guarantee everything was altogether perfect (small nuances can still exist) nor did it mean it would be complete, but it meant that for what I had there was some strong corresponding component of truth to the part the reconciled the data.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\nchange the core concepts -> change the pattern of data predicted by these concepts to exist -> shift the pattern of present off its axis of symmetry with the *actual* pattern of data that does exist -> lose the balance of harmony that I had achieved. \n\nOn this, the epistemology is much stronger than if it were isolated to itself because it's being packaged with a real world demonstration of what this looks like in terms of solving out this great brain mystery of sleep. Hence, it's merit is demonstrable. \n\n\nWhere I am now is that I have the paper mostly written, I'm just tinkering with writing in the introduction -- not changing concepts at this point because everything works fine. The thing is I've just never actually published a paper before, and it's a lot of work to submit because it's introducing some very big ideas that people are not accustomed to, and the entire thing is overwhelmingly. My theories are right, but the fear is if I don't say things perfectly right away they may get prematurely dismissed before having the chance to make the proper arguments and showcase what these concepts to do, and it feels paralyzing sometimes trying to get everything perfect."

I hope you don't take that personally or anything because it has nothing to do with you. Usually when I comment on science on here it's vague enough that it doesn't matter, but I can't be both vague and specific simultaneously.\n\nI actually really value our correspondence on here, I've never had a chance to communicate my ideas to someone else because I'm no longer in the proper environment for it and it makes it hard writing out a paper when you have no idea how the audience is going to be able to receive the idea you are trying to communicate.\n\nYou are actually right not to accept the claims I am making beyond acknowledging partial aspects because they are making very strong claims and reaching fairly revolutionary conclusions while providing only partial arguments and continuing to stay relatively vague. This is the reached conundrum in our discussion though, because while these arguments can be continued with specifically detailed logical continuations to validate them, it would mean turnover detailed core aspects of my work before submitting the paper. If you're not familiar with neuroscience and biochemistry, it also makes it harder to demonstrate how this epistemology isn't just a theoretical description but translates quite spectacular in terms of it's real world application.\n\nIt looks like this packaged together:\n\n1. My field-specific work in brain sciences demonstrates that by focusing on tracking information into patterns across the system it guarantees reality (this isn't just a claim, but because it works it creates a situation where the physical data is overwhelmingly consistent and anyone can see that)\n\n2. My epistemology work (which we are discussing) is essentially the result of me understanding that this *does* work (you do not need to understand why it works to see that it does) and then over serious reflection and quite a bit of time I eventually figured out the basis for why this works. Because it's mathematically, when it's correctly explained it's validity because self-evident in the context of what it is claiming. This comes back to the axiom I wrote out before.\n\nAs you can see, however, this packaging together is a much stronger product than either of the two things isolated to themselves. While each could stand on their own in theory, when package together it becomes especially difficult to deny because each validates the other."

I get [cluster headaches](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache) after the auras finish for me if I just power through the auras, and will go to the hospital for monitoring if I know one is coming. They are terrifying. I'd rather have kidney stones every week than go through that.\n\nMy triggers are kind of odd, and the whole thing is related to a tbi I had ice skating when i was 7. Jumping (including running, which sucks), dark chocolate, violent vomiting, and pulling all nighters are all pretty reliable at giving me a migrane.

During the industrial revolution, child labor was used for the smaller hands being able to do things adult hands couldn't (as well as various other, often more despicable reasons).  Children were used as mining labor for years because they are smaller and therefore could fit into tighter spaces.\n\nThese are just the ones I know of without any specialized education in industrial history.

Again, labor was their normal.\n\nI never argued an apprenticeship wasn't educational, but unlike modern education where you learn by theory with little risk, they learned through practical application where even a small mistake could be life altering.  That was their normal.\n\nThe only things I have been presenting are the concept that \"normal\" isn't a universal thing, and that children shouldn't be a source of labor is a more modern concept.  To say they should have a normal childhood is equivalent to saying they should have the status quo instead of they should have better."

It was just carefully manipulated data and buzzwords. My college professor was a liberal, one of my favorites, and I wanted to make him proud. I took the statistics and data and I twisted the truth until the conclusion was tighter gun control. I got an A. I didn't win a pulitzer, but I got a degree. What did I learn in college? Do your research and use it to say anything you need it to. Cool story. This article about the tribal groups having spirit guides and crossdressers (yes I skimmed) does not have anything to do with the non binary nonsense we are facing today.

Sometimes, people who we can see the bone structure of would likely be considered male in terms of sex would be buried as a female with all the ceremonial accompaniments of someone who lived as a woman.

And then it was a San Diego men's choir singing we're coming for your kids and doctors chopping penises and breasts off of children. This Trans shit is serious! Dead serious. We need to stop it now."

People are activity running these rounds, and if you play on maps thats more pvp focus you will see it more. \n\nLike said lvl 5 armor is your only savior from this gun, but a 20 rd mag dump is not the same as 30 or 50. Lvl 4 is only ok for 3 shots because the lower the dur the better chance that the bullet will pen and bcp is 88 damage to your 85 chest. tier 4 armor is what most players are running with the exception of the 15%. \n\nThis gun is definitely op and if you have the money to try it out I would do it. The recoil its got right now is comparable to an akm but the ability to unalive you faster with whatever round if you are wearing tier 4. With meta rounds tier 5 and 6 won't help in cqb, don't even have to aim for the head."

It\u2019s complex at first but one tip is to map out the route you want to take and then look how other spawns cross with it and start to take note of when you died in raid and from what spawn did they come from, and you can slowly piece together a mental image of how people are going to move around the map and might enable you to make a crazy decision like running past en entire floor because you believe it\u2019s only 1 guy up there. \n\nDefinitely could just be cheating too, it\u2019s super prevalent in this game sometimes if you bring in better gear they will hunt you something to keep in mind"

And M856A1 is generally good enough for .556 weapons (and is better than M995 for scav kills due to the 40+ damage, allowing it to always one tap scavs).\n\nAs such, the overall best thing to craft is probably green gunpowder > 7.62 BP on repeat. The BP craft is the only source of excellent ammo for the RD-704 and Mutant, if you have either unlocked. And the green gunpowder craft is an easy way of getting green gunpowder cheap for the BP craft.\n\nBut if you're not looking for high-tier ammo, magnum buckshot is pretty solid if you like to run shotguns.

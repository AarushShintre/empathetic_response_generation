The update makes it seem less likely- since you are correct that it could be from other peers, but it\u2019s all guesses still. Current info is vague on source of influence. He could be a dad who needed more information before getting onboard or a guy who has no issue with lesbian couples but dislikes gay men- because there are plenty of examples of both types of fathers.

But it\u2019s kinda infantilizing someone to say they cannot choose to sleep with someone doesn\u2019t reciprocate their feelings. Some of us can be mature about our feelings and don\u2019t want others treating us like children who can\u2019t make their own choices. I\u2019ve had fwb who I clearly felt more strongly about, and guess what I was a big boy and just because I couldn\u2019t date her didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t be friends or separate the physical. Just because you can\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean everyone else shouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to. These things should be taken case by case not with some blanket rule that will blatantly leave some people out in the cold. Sure we didn\u2019t make tons of emotional eye contact, or talk about starting a family, I didn\u2019t create a life with her like I have with my current girlfriend. For me the emotional intimacy isn\u2019t based in sex, that\u2019s just one way to express it. It\u2019s about the emotional and mental intimacy, and that elevates the sex separately.  \n\nSome of us can separate the physical and emotional and we shouldn\u2019t be getting shamed for it. I\u2019m monogamous in relationships and would never cheat, but I still don\u2019t think sex is that big a deal between 2 consenting adults. If the other person is clearly emotionally unwell at the time then it\u2019s just as shitty to purpose a purely physical relationship as it is an emotional one. Their hurt makes asking them to make any choice like that in the moment unfair. It has nothing to do with sex, in fact selling them a car or house or something would probably be the same type of bad and kinda worse because of the scale of consequences."

If they came to me crying or giving a desperate confession of love, I would not. Even if you cannot believe someone who is ok with casual sex would consider the feelings of another, it\u2019s just self destructive and reckless with your own safety and reputation. Doing that creates people who have a strong emotional attachment and a likelihood of acting out less than rationally. \n\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t even op, she just told him she had feelings for him and he wasn\u2019t ready to date. Op was the one approaching a person in an emotional place, post breakup. She was fully able to decide for herself that she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable doing that. Having feelings for someone doesn\u2019t make you suddenly unable to make rational decisions involving them, it\u2019s the scale of those feelings that matter, op didn\u2019t express any insane feelings that would have made the proposal unethical. She\u2019s an adult who can manage her own feelings without other people taking those choices from her.

If you had told me that the professor was a caricature of an evil businessman I'd believe you.  He'd go on tangents on the things you don't have to inform customers about and how employees should be kept in the dark about different topics. He was a guest professor who also ran a local business so I suspect the school just didn't vet him at all and he got in based on being friends with the dean."

Every time she did anything she got a free pass and eventually it became a learned behavior, she used it to control how she could get things from people and would enjoy forcing people to apologize to her for upsetting her into doing things. It\u2019s very very hard to hold mentally ill people accountable for things when it isn\u2019t their fault for being mentally ill and how it changes their ability to interact with the world, but I can say from experience that this family choosing to shelter this man from the consequences is going to ruin any chance of him leading a positive life. And they are going to ruin other lives in the process. OP should also take a hard look at how how is refusal to report this and other occurrences makes his wife feel. She cannot possibly be okay knowing a nine year old was assaulted and no one is protecting her and it bothers me that he agrees with his family that it should stay in the family skeleton closet."

I will point out that you\u2019re extremely defensive in your tone, sarcastic, defensive, etc, writing in all caps which can be taken as yelling over text.\n\nAlso, tone is hard to grasp over text. Some people are also not great at understand sarcasm, and what you commented didn\u2019t sound sarcastic or like a joke. \n\nIn my opinion, this is like if someone said their pool flooded their backyard but they meant that in a hyperbolic sense and someone who works on pools gave them advice and the original poster became defensive and said they were being condescending and got really rude in response to their trying to help. \n\nRemember the person. I know the internet makes it seem like I\u2019m not a real person and you can talk however you want to me, but I was just trying to offer advice. I didn\u2019t take this as an opportunity to condescend, I took it as an opportunity to give insight as that is my job.

To me, telling someone how to raise their child would be more overarching and general. \n\nThe definition of condescension is showing a feeling of superiority. Just because someone gives you advice doesn\u2019t mean they think they are superior to you. With a mindset like that, it is hard to accept feedback and not become defensive when someone gives you feedback, because you\u2019ll think everyone giving you feedback thinks they are better than you, which isn\u2019t the case here.\n\nNo one is better than anyone else inherently, but some people to have backgrounds that are more related to some topics. Mine just happens to be helping parents find solutions in parenting. \n\nSorry that I misconstrued your original comment, I feel that there were two paths you could have taken with the advice, you could have just said I don\u2019t need it, or you could have gotten angry with me for giving it.

[Genuine acceptance of the child in the peer group creates the basis for healthy development while rejection from peers from an early age brings about such risks as externalizing problems (poor school adaptation, physical aggressiveness) and internalizing problems (loneliness, social anxiety, depression, and\nnegative self-esteem) (Dijkstra, 2004)](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1241768.pdf)\n\n- The ability to realise the risks that if they don't like it, there is no way to undo it. A wig is not a good way to undo it if they intend to grow their hair back. Good wigs are also crazy expensive.\n\n- The ability to realise that other children will probably not feel the same way as they feel, and that given the herd mentality of schools and groups, the general consensus may sway the group and she may be ostracised.\n\nThe reason I gave drugs and alcohol as an example is because they have to understand:\n\n- Smoking is harmful\n\n- Smoking is vaguely enjoyable once you have done it a lot\n\n- The enjoyment fades and is replaced by a compulsion to do it endlessly\n\n- You will smell awful\n\nI would choose an 8 year old to make the right decision for smoking basically every time. But the former is far more complex and difficult to grasp.\n\n> If you would force-feed your child to avoid them getting mocked for being skinny then you\u2019re a fucking awful parent.\n\nAgain, it comes back to harm. Being skinny is normal, being fussy over foods is normal, watching different TV is normal liking different things is normal normal normal.\n\nI would say though that if your kid is getting too high of a BMI that you should put them on a diet.

She told me she would let this one slide and to do it next time. I was firm, no, I don't do fentyal and I told her of my concerns because I have absuse parents who have looked for ways to take my kids. She told me CPS wasn't a big deal as she deals with them all the time. I insisted. The retest came back positive. All the over the counter tests were negative. I ordered a more sensitive test and I insisted on going to a different lab. At this lab, I couldn't take my purse in, they didn't allow the trash bin in the room, they put a tab in the toilet to make sure the pee wasn't tampered with and dumped. They checked the temperature of the urine to make sure it came from me. And would you look at that, my test was all of a sudden negative.

I think I just can't get past the idea of a $130k house being an absolute hole, because here a $350k house would be, and I still can't get past the concept of a $130k house even existing."

She manipulated it as that he had to do absolutely everything for her and yet she would constantly put him down. Every day she would completely mess up the house and then he'd have to come home and clean it up and then she'd put him down. Even. Day. My mom is exactly like this woman and I can tell you as someone who grew up with this sort of manipulative, abusive, narcissist, that these people don't change and the damage they do to you is deep and long lasting. My mom has been in therapy for years and will only over uses to validate her not working on herself and weaponize whatever her therapist says against you by taking it out of context, which is what OP also did to her husband. OP straight up has PTSD from all of the things his wife put him through and he blames himself for it all and thinks that he needs to keep supporting her. That is very common for victims of abusive relationships.  And it is awful. He's going back to his abuser. Even if she has changed (which she hasn't yet, she's just promising that she will.

Go ahead and google lactose allergy and find pages of articles (written for patients, not doctors) correcting you. Then find a single one agreeing with you. If its a commonly accepted use like you say, it must exist.\n\nYou know that I meant that someone who can wear glasses and mostly correct their vision calling themselves blind would be an unfair co-opting of a condition more serious than the one they have. Deliberately taking the worst possible understanding of what I have said and using it to try and insult me when I have been nothing but polite shows you are both a fundamentally unpleasant person and aware that the opinion you have doesn't stand up to scrutiny.\n\nPeople with food allergies, even if mild, should avoid that food entirely. A previous immune response does not mean that every future one will be the same. Allergies can get worse with no warning. Most people don't consider that risk worth it, and doctors advise against taking it. \n\nLactose intolerant people can always just accept the digestive discomfort or pop a few lactase and experience nothing.

Root barrier may help move roots grow away from plumbing.\n\nOnce a crack appears due to subsistence, roots can grow in between cracks. A good example of plastic working is a root bound container pot of a tree in the garden center. Roots don't bust out of the container.

Galvanized steel pipes more than thirty years old can become very severely restricted with internal corrosion. This effect is accelerated if the galvanized is allowed to be direct electrolytic contact with copper. When water flows through metal pipes a very weak electrical current is created because of the presence of magnetically polar ions present in the water. Since galvanized steel has a lower electrolytic potential compared to copper, if the two differing metals are allowed to conduct this very weak current causes the steel lose surface electrons to match the potential of the copper. This loss of electrons causes the galvanized coating to gradually decompose into a thick, black scale that chokes the inside of the pipe. This same process can happen even if the galvanized is not indirect contact with copper (it's how the galvanized coating protects the underlying steel from rust). It just happens more slowly. For that reason most engineers consider the service life of galv steel supply pipe to be no more than 40 years."

If this is the case, it\u2019s not a huge issue, but you\u2019ll want to better air seal those penetrations soon to prevent this issue in the future because the last thing you want is water accumulating in walls over time and causing mold or rot to specific areas of your new home."

It's usually just from stress placed on the drywall between the door frame and the beam and can be fixed with some caulk and paint.  Or if you really want to go nuts you can cut the crack out and fix the drywall with drywall patch, mesh tape, or something similar.  It's usually not something structural, but as the other poster noted, keep an eye on it, especially if it expands or comes back after the fix.\n\nDepending on where you live, drywall cracks are just a fact of life.\n\nThough I'm just a homeowner with an unfortunate amount of experience fixing drywall (because the stupid earth won't stop quaking here), not a professional."

And where we live has extreme temperature swings (could be in the upper 30\u2019s at night, then lower 70\u2019s the next day). And the drywall is new. So hoping all of this means that it\u2019s not a big concern, but will monitor it."

If the drywall was older with the house mostly settled, and no recent issues had occurred like thermal effects or minor seismic activity, then it might be more concerning.  But likely the house moved in someway and the drywall wasn't sure if it wanted to tag along so it cracked due to the pressure between the door frame and the beam.\n\nHow strong was that first earthquake and how'd you react to it?  Haha, I remember feeling my first EQ when I first moved to Alaska about 15 years ago and it completely freaked me out!  Now I barely register anything below a 5.0 and only get concerned if it goes on for longer than 10 seconds.  We had a 7.1 back in November of 2018 that seemed to go on forever (though I think it only lasted 30-45 seconds) and did quite a bit of damage across southcentral AK though - including several 10s of thousands of dollars in damage to my house.  Not a fun day."

Honestly would\u2019ve thought it was just old house things if I didn\u2019t find out there was a quake nearby at that exact minute."

Smaller ones can be kind of thrilling but they get old fast haha!\n\nThat 2018 EQ had aftershocks (some of them M5-6 on their own) that went on for MONTHS, it was nuts.  Right after that, we had a bunch of articles in the paper comparing that EQ to the 1964 Good Friday quake (M9.2), which destroyed much of the southcentral area.  That EQ went on for over 4 1/2 minutes!!!  I can't even imagine...\n\nAnyway, good luck with the repair.  With a little patience, you should be able to blend the fix in pretty well since it looks pretty hairline.  Cheers!"

Interior wall finishing is removed, exterior siding is removed, and rough opening framing is installed into the wall cavity to support the exterior sheathing and siding, the interior finishing, and the fan itself (along with power). Then the exterior side fan grill is mounted to the sheathing, sealed with exterior sealant, flashed with tape woven correctly into the WRB, and finished with a drip cap, before siding is restored. Basically like installing a very small flange mounted vinyl window into an existing wall. If it's happening at a second story scaffolding is required."

Also the flex duct is cheap so you can replace it every year or so and save a lot of time and money by not having to clean it. Lastly, if you do go with hard pipe you should still use a small section of flex duct to connect the hard pipe to the dryer to account for dryer movement."

Washer and furnace should not be connected in any way, so if the washer leaks when running, maybe a leak in the white PVC pipe drain above the furnace somewhere? When it hits some electrical component in the furnace, it could lock the furnace out from starting until it dries out. Then when the thermostat calls for heat again, it could work for some time. At least until you do laundry again. Soon enough, the leaking water will burn out something or multiple electrical components in the furnace."

Also two things I doubt you sanded enough for the thickness of two coats of paint and more likely when you painted the hinge side cutouts you didn\u2019t cutout the pooled paint in the corners. I bet if you look at the hinge plates there crooked 1/8\u201d by resting on a pool of dried paint in the morticed corners. Take a razor blade and cut out this little bit should work better. Also next time leave the hinge plates on and mask with tape it\u2019s how the pros do it."

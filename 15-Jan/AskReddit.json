Her parents call her \u201cAoif-beef\u201d literally because it rhymes \ud83d\ude02 and because she\u2019s so cute she\u2019s edible. \n\nSo, me and her Mum got tattoos of a joint of beef on a plate! Had so much fun getting it and explaining it to the tattoo artist. Also means if I ever lose my voice, I can still get served at a carvery! \n\nThe other tattoo is not quite so light-hearted. A few years ago, my family suffered a horrific loss. My four year old cousin was diagnosed with a highly aggressive, late-stage brain cancer in December and died in April. \n\nI visited her in the hospice (a childs hospice is a beautiful but devastating place that should never exist) and she was unrecognisable and took a scary turn while I was there. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever sobbed that hard after I left.\n\nAt her funeral, after she was interred, I was sitting on a bench with another cousin while my aunt and gran stood nearby. A blue butterfly started hovering around and flew into the open plot before  flying around us and away. Ellie was buried in a blue dress. \n\nI\u2019m not usually a spiritual person, but we all felt it was Ellie, letting us know she was finally OK.\n\nOn her 1-year anniversary, I got a tattoo of a blue butterfly, flying up towards a star (twinkle twinkle was her favourite and played at her funeral) and the \u201cflight trail\u201d spells out a lower-case \u201ce\u201d \n\nSorry for the long post!"

Its only 3% n most pp just keep on living(talking about experiences that u probably dont even have)\n5. The country that allow their men 2 die in war are the same countries that couldn't care less about women's rights... those r the countries where the women cant leave their husbands n go 2 jail when they get r4ped, those r the countries who kill women 4 nt wearing a hijab the right way\n6. U call that last kindgarten thing a problem? 4 women its no better bc if u like a dude u cant go up 2 him bc if he doesn't go 2 u he doesnt like bc men r expected 2 make the same move.

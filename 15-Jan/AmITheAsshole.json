If the Twinkie diet results are disquieting for anyone, it's not those of us who generally espouse mainstream nutrition principles. Rather, it pretty emphatically rebuts claims in such works as Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes, which suggests that the role of calories in weight is subordinate to the source of calories.\n\nCalories are a unit of energy, and the relationship between matter and energy figures prominently among the physical laws of the universe. An aggregation of high quality science, and the gaps in that science, provide opportunities for nutritionists to debate and defend some competing theories and perspectives. But the laws of physics are not among them. They are not negotiable.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.burnthefatinnercircle.com/public/The_Twinkie_Diet.cfm\n\nhttps://www.liberty.edu/champion/2010/11/man-loses-27-pounds-with-twinkie-based-diet/\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/comfort-cravings/201011/the-twinkie-diet\n\nhttps://chasebarron.com/calories-vs-clean-eating-how-to-lose-weight-on-the-twinkie-diet-with-professor-mark-haub-phd/\n\n\u201cMeaning \u2013 if you want to lose fat, then you\u2019ll have to eat fewer Calories than you burn.

Not everyone handles the heat well. If I went to sleep at 68\u00b0, I would wake up overheated and puking. I cannot sleep with the temperature much higher than 64\u00b0, or I'll wake up sick. My partner prefers it warmer, but I always tell him that he can always put on more layers if he's cold, but the I can't remove an infinite amount of layers. Once I'm in my underwear, I can't go any further. The same thing applies for you. You can always add layers to warm up, but they cannot necessarily remove them. That said, if the roomie is wearing five layers at 62\u00b0, they can strip one off and you can warm the space up. If you're wearing a t-shirt and pants at 68\u00b0, you can wear a sweater."

I did my best to try to get her back, but it took eight years. The visits would have continued if I had been able to afford them and if her father hadn't been so obstructive. During that time, we adopted my niece out of a traumatic situation. Some might say my daughter should be traumatized by the fact that her mom \"chose her cousin over her\", but my daughter understands where her cousin was and doesn't begrudge the adoption at all, even if she was sad she wasn't the one moving. \n\nNone of that matters here, though. Because my point is: don't try to brew trauma where there isn't any. My niece has trauma, my daughter doesn't, even though some might in her shoes. I would not appreciate someone telling my resilient child who says she doesn't feel trauma that she should feel it. Why should she attempt to brew and foster a sense of trauma where none grew organically? I mean, I *could* be angry at that guy who cut me off in traffic yesterday, but should I really try to rustle up some road rage I don't feel simply because someone else might have felt road rage in that situation?

When we first got together I tried to get along with her but it's getting harder. She assumes she's the smartest person in the room and speaks down to everyone. Personally, I don't really care. She's my husband's friend and I don't have to be close with her. What bothers me most is that she's not nice *to him*.\n\nI understand that there's a lot of history that I wasn't there for. I really tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and just roll with it, but some things no amount of history excuses. He'd bring up a thought or idea and she'd immediately cut across him with \"that's stupid\", before going off on a tirade about.. Nothing? Something not really related to what was being said.\n\nHe always says \"that's just how she is\", and \"I don't take it personally\". He says that they've been very close friends for 10+ years and I don't have context to a lot of what they talk about. I say that close friends don't put you down or treat you as less than them.\n\nIt bothers me so much that this \"best friend\" of his clearly has no respect for him. He disagrees with that, but whenever I get more specific I get more \"that's how she is\".\n\nI think he remembers a better time in their friendship and holds onto that. She is very important to him and I respect that absolutely, I just don't want anyone putting him down which is all she ever seems to do. I also don't want our kids seeing him take this shit from someone who he insists cares about him.\n\nOur eldest loves this friend, but I honestly think it's because my husband speaks so highly of her, a lot. They haven't really interacted a huge amount. The other kids are too young to really have an opinion.\n\nFor the time being I'm trying hard to not jump to conclusions - I tend to think that what she says is negative when he describes his conversations with her, because that has been my experience of her. We're going to try to meet up with her in a relaxed setting with mutual friends, and I am going to keep an open mind and try to have a good time and let some things slide (like an amount of just incorrect information), but I *do* plan on speaking up, calmly, if she crosses any lines. If this meeting doesn't go well I'm not going to see her again, I don't think this would make me TA because I'm obviously allowed my own boundaries. I might be TA if I ask him not to bring the kids around her, because she *is* his friend and does mean a lot to him. I don't want them seeing someone treating one of their parents like shit on her shoe. That may be an exaggeration. I'm not sure.\n\nAdditional info: we haven't seen her in person for a couple of years, and my husband spoke to her for the first time in quite a few months recently. He had stopped contacting her first because he was tired of always being the one to call. She only called because another friend told her he had been seriously ill.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When I first met her I was caught really off guard by her behaviour, and the relationship was relatively new (we weren't married yet, just dating) so I didn't feel I could do much other than say it to my partner, and he brushed it off. I tried to get along with her and even met up with her and another mutual friend without my husband there, but it was really uncomfortable for me so I didn't do it again. Another time my husband asked her to help me out with something when I was pregnant, which turned into her trying to \"coach\" me, while doing an absolutely shit job of the very simple task we needed to do. I humoured her on the coaching front and tried to go with it, and we found some common ground, but not enough.\n\nI'm definitely going to be much more direct when we meet again, and my husband has agreed that this is the right approach this time. I also apologised to him for my reactions when he talks about her but explained I hate hearing about her because every time she's said something shitty to him.\n\nI'm having some very strong feelings about it all but that's on me and I won't let it affect how I deal with her."

Walks nicely by my side, darts under the table at meetings, and sprawls on his mat to hang out and wait for me to need him, keeps his nose to himself in grocery stores.  Then back home, he checks to see if anyone left any stuff to get into trouble with."

Your described deep dive in the fine history says that. To say nothing of the suspicious jump straight from \"level 1\" to \"level 3\".\n\nAnd really, a \"not paying attention\" fine? I mean, I get the drafting process needs a certain amount of focus, but its also a long and tedious process. I've never done fantasy anything and I know that.\n\nI'd not be surprised if a goodly share of those fines were not because someone wasn't paying attention, but because the last 2 or 3 picks had busted part of their planned pick strategy and were taking a moment to collect themselves while they decided on their next move.\n\nAdd to that the fact that you don't know where those fines are going... not sure that'd pass the smell test even if it was Tycho Brahe doing the sniffing.\n\nEven if they are going towards his league fees that seems off. He should be out of pocket on his fees and buy-in, just like the rest of you. Not subsidized by fines paid by the rest of you. Particularly when the person levying the fines is also the one benefiting from them.\n\nAnd maybe it's my ignorance, but are monetary fines actually the norm in fantasy leagues?\n\nI'd suggest two things.\n\nFirst, demand an accounting of what the fines are being used for before paying (if you do pay). And not just to you either. To the group as a whole. You all should know this, and have input whether the fines should continue.\n\nSeond, if you stick around, push for group votes on those \"inattention\" fines during the draft. (assuming the fines don't get ditched) If you've got someone who really is spacing off, maybe they deserve it. But at least then you'd also know you were annoying the group as a whole, not just one person."

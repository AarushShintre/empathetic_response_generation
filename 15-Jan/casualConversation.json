They had us on some crazy hours, spending 14-16 hrs in the schoolhouse each day. The work they had us doing was also pretty intense. All exams were free response only and we had one nearly every week. It sucked.\n\nBut it was a huge learning experience for me. I know my limits now and how to study efficiently. I feel like college is gonna be a breeze bc of this, but there's still room for surprises I suppose. If college is anything like high school then I have confidence that I'll do fine.\n\nProbably the biggest thing I have to get used to is how the whole process works, like how to register/drop classes, what books to get and how to get them, etc. I didn't have to worry about that in the military, I was just given everything all at once.\n\nI'm currently doing full time taking 4 classes, and I'm getting all the classes I don't like over with first (so classes like english and speech). My schedule isn't so bad actually. I have 3 day weekends so I'll have plenty of time to relax. Mental health is a big priority for me but I think I'll be fine.\n\nI'm looking forward to meeting new people and filling in my time with classes. It's gonna be a good year for me I'd say."

If not, then I'll just find a good job or something.\n\nAlso thanks, I appreciate it. I'm not really busy rn so I might message later \ud83d\udc4d"

I've tried a million and barely any have any noticable effects for me, I think its probably the same for 99% of them, but then again the placebo effect works and if it helps people feel better about themselves then why not?\n\nBefore your first workout I'd suggest either finding a beginners plan and researching the correct movements, or just writing out what you're looking to do, I used to turn up and wing it, then realised I was only working out arms and forgetting legs.\n\nTypically I split my workouts into body parts that compliment each other (e.g. shoulders and chest are best buds for a lot of natural movements and tasks and you'll find your back and biceps despite being seperate also work together if you were to imagine lifting something heavy up) - you might want to google \"push pull workout plans\" as its a common way of doing it and provides an even structure across the week. \n\n\"Push\" - these are your chest presses, shoulder presses etc - I do two most important (dumbell chest press and flies) to start, then other \"accessory\" excercises after like cable flies. \n\n\"Pull\" - Pull downs, Bicep curls, Rows etc - again whatever is the most effort or \"biggest\" excercise, ill get the pulldowns and rows out the way and move on to others like the bicep curls. \n\n\"Legs\" - Squats, Leg press, leg raises, leg curls, lunges etc  - legs are the biggest muscle group in the body so get their own day.  \n\nbetween days I'll do maybe 30 mins of running as a session. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a personal note about falling into it, you'll 'never be big enough' is a common phrase thrown about in the gym, and you'll always compare yourself to others there, but if you can just ignore that voice its all good. If I could show 14 year old obese me how I would turn out at 31 I'd be so happy. I'm not shredded but in decent working shape. \n\nI personally don't tend to weigh myself. You just know from your clothes and belt, if I could be bothered I'd probably do progress pics too, so yeah good idea!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to DM any time and I can't wait to hear how you get on."

I remember someone once told me that I should stick to more reps of lower weights so I don't get a lot bigger, is that true?

The average folk among us will be fine with the standard 3 sets of 8-12 so I\u2019d say just stick with that. Women will find it hard to get very muscly without serious supplementation (or steroids) because of the lower levels of testosterone, generally the girls at the gym who are strong as shit just look pretty well toned so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about that."

Their sister was a bridge. I think that's why I liked it so much. They showed you the answer to why are they like this, and then built upon that as they grew up and changed, and learned from their regrets and their relationships, or fell deeper into that dark pit because they had no one.\n\nXue Yang though, maybe if he didn't keep laughing the same way Wei Wuxian did I might feel he's more evil than insane and broken.

But not in the household that was raising me.\n\n> I know I\u2019ve been through some hard times, and a random compliment from a stranger on something like my hair, or a small conversation about a band or pop culture shirt, has made my day. So I try to do the same for others.\n\nThis is such a huge thing to me. I don't understand how other people can't see how important it can be. I know I'll never get the random attention myself, but I can clearly see the need in others the same way I feel that need. So I try to give it to them, because people need kindness and attention."

(I wouldn't call myself a people pleaser.)\n\nFor the longest time I thought I was unexpected, but came to realize the truth later on. I was conceived to manipulate several people. There was a bonus of me having a heart defect that required major surgery. Unfortunately, I survived my surgery, causing many issues for the one that was looking for a convenient disposal method.\n\nI'm an only child that still wasn't the favorite child.\n\nI was very neglected growing up. I had to work hard for attention, too. Unless it was negative attention. That somehow found me really easily. (I'm not referring to acting out for attention.)\n\nNot gonna lie, I do get something out of brightening someone else's day. I'll always just be that lonely kid that wishes someone would notice me enough to talk to me, even if just for a few minutes. That's dying inside for some kind words.\n\nI think I hone in on that in other people, and I feel the need to fulfill that desperate need of theirs. Recognition from other people.\n\nI don't think you're *not* kind at heart. You're meeting two needs, someone else's and your own.\n\nI do hope you can overcome the people pleasing, because in my experience with a lot of people (both trying to please people when I was younger and watching others try to please people) is that it's hard to really find yourself as a person and hard to find fulfillment in life that isn't dependent on potentially awful people taking advantage of you. Also, other people don't tend to see the real you, just the one that pleases them.\n\nIf you'd like someone to talk to (no pleasing required), feel free to message me. \n\nI hope you have a great day. :)"

I've never been one to act moody and then say \"Oh I'm a Scorpio, I can't help it.\" Instead I am aware that being a Scorpio makes me prone to mood swings, and I actively work to keep them under control, despite the challenge, always taking responsibility and never using my sign as an excuse to avoid blame or consequences, but acknowledging that it's a little more difficult for me and requires a bit more effort to control. I'm Sagittarius Rising, and I believe my Mars and Venus are in the exact opposite signs from the ones they naturally rule, so yeah, my chart is chock full of challenges, but the important thing is that I don't let those challenges define who I am or control my life. I am my own person, in charge of my own life. My zodiacs do not define me, they simply make certain aspects of life easier or more challenging depending on their position, requiring me to work harder in some areas while others come naturally to me.

I didnt know i\u2019ll need to clarity this but i posted this because i was just casually thinking of the future and stuff and this is one of the many things that came to my mind, it\u2019s not because my main goal in life is to just gift kids to people. I know kids arent just some dolls you have for fun but they require real care and love, i know the hardships of having kids and how life works. I love kids myself and i want to have them in the future because that\u2019s just how i feel and hopefully i\u2019ll be a great mom when the time comes, it\u2019s just that while thinking of this I imagined how happy my mom will be when she becomes a grandma so i wanted to share that. Believe me i wont just carelessly have kids out of selfishness, i know they deserve loving parents who will take care of them mentally, physically and financially while acknowledging that they\u2019re humans and not accessories"

Can AI really substitute the \"thinker\"?\r  \nOr is the AI an instrument in the hands of the thinker?\r  \n\r  \nSecondly, in the next future may AI replace a lot of knowledge-based jobs?

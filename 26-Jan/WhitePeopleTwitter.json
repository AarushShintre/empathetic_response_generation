They used to *constantly* raid the only gay bar in town (stonewall) for no reason other than gay people gathered there. Gay people fought back. \n\nIf Lawrence v Texas is overturned, we will return to that in states like Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and most likely Florida. Homes and bars will be raised constantly for \u201csuspicion of homosexual activity\u201d. Having sex with your partner will be forbidden. It\u2019ll go further though than just \u201csodomy\u201d - it\u2019ll be a ban on any form of activity, including kissing or holding hands, and any artwork or cinema of the same. Simply watching a gay show like will and grace on tv will have you arrested and probably register as a sex offender. \n\nIt will, quite literally, be the coming of Gilead.

Total COVID expenditures are quite large - about 4.6T through the end of 2022 (3 years) as you can see [here](https://www.usaspending.gov/disaster/covid-19?publicLaw=all), so that'd come out to a bit under 2T in the first year, which was the increase that was seen over the 1T projected deficit (3.1T versus ~1T).  The tax breaks he implemented were back in 2017 and, from what I read at least, mostly took effect before 2020.  Correct me if I'm wrong on any of this.\n\n>  And a huge financial crisis hit at the end of W. Bush's term, with massive federal stimulus commitments that mostly hit during Obama's Presidency\n\nWell, yeah, enormous \"economic stimulus\" without a corresponding change in tax will run up a huge deficit.  As you can see from the chart in the previous message, deficits under Obama continue above Bush levels throughout his presidency.  Just the facts here.\n\n> Also Trump's increase over Obama's 8 years happened in just 4 years.\n\nYep, I accounted for that in my first message.  8 year adjusted for Trump would be a 56% increase, or roughly 5.7% year over year."

He didn't cancel med debt because he can't dummy. They only did schooling because there's a law allowing him too, which the right tried to stop even though ppp loans, tax cuts for wealthy, stealing from taxes for own businesses, and stimulus checks were all okay in the republican budget. 6 billion to solve world hunger has been debunked and the US gave equipment WORTH that much, not actual money dumbass. Bet you get everything from fox, an ENTERTAINMENT show that was took to court and confessed they just lie for ratings. Don't reproduce"

Biden got handed a shit sandwich, just like Obama, and had to spend years cleaning up the previous republican party's mess. How do you expect our leader to make improvements to the house when they have to clean the interior first. Do you know how much tax money Trump stole and how much it's costing to take him to court? What a waste"

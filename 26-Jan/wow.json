They also moved quick sip so it\u2019s basically a required pick unless you want healing elixirs or staggering strikes which are both underwhelming imo. Other than that, they removed the 2nd rank of several talents, but those extra points are pretty much stuck going to the new talents at the top of the tree anyway, so most of the bottom half is identical to before. \n\nEven still, I think most brew mains are reaching higher and higher ilvl by now which is really enabling stagger\u2019s potential. I think it\u2019s lame having a tank be notoriously weak early in an expansion and notoriously strong late when the only deciding factor is the number of agility points on your gear. You can be amazing at brew but if you\u2019re under geared, your basic mitigation just won\u2019t totally work as expected and it\u2019s kinda lame in that way, but yeah, I think if you\u2019re over 405 ilvl you should be feeling pretty tanky now."

There are other catchup systems to give you easy gear like the elemental storms and also World Quest gear scales up as you get higher item level. Crafted gear can also be very strong, though if you are doing mostly solo play, that will be harder to find a good crafter. Doing any of these things will continue to get you better gear and that's all you have to do. No azerite power, artifact power grind or any of that from the previous 3 expacs (Legion, BFA, SL)\n\nedit: one more thing to add. because of no AP grind, it is a much more alt-friendly expansion, which also means more people running through lower level stuff to do their alts and stuff so finding groups for lower level stuff shouldn't be as hard as previous expacs either."

Like chainlightning + chainheal or riptide + flame shock to spare a bunch of actionbar space and a bunch of hotkeys. Maybe other healers use harm/help macros too.

For BigWigs you need LittleWigs also which is the dungeon specific version.\n\nPlater: Changes the default nameplates. It shows most of relatable information you need. The base profile colour codes the enemy hp bars accord to aggro in PVE and class colour in PVP. But you can download profiles which tailors it in to other ways like focus targets are different coloured as others so you know by a glance which mob to burst down and many more things.\n\nWeakAuras: This addon basically can do anything. It is really complex if you want to do things with it by yourself but there are many-many things that already done and you can download them from Wago.IO . PS: Luxthos class specific WeakAuras are really useful. They are a bit bloated but for starting out is enough and even for high end use it is totally useable.\n\nAuctionator: Adds new tabs for auction house to make your buying and selling easier. Also shows in tooltips and on profession tab on what sells for how much.\n\nDetails: For showing damage numbers, healing numbers threat and many other things.\n\nThese I would say useful for most people.\n\nAnd also you could check around in the wow category on [curseforge.com](https://curseforge.com) and you can find things that maybe tickles your fancy."

Or if you force a limit on ALL orders, then you throw the price of items through the roof and remove the ability for players to make items for their friends/guildies...you solve problem for new crafters but create new ones on top of it.\n\nWhat makes the current system beneficial to new crafters, is that on public orders they will always have equal opportunity on crafting items that they can make. The onky person who takes any loss is the buyer, but they can always recraft the item and not suffer much from it. The minute you make a list of all crafters on the server that is easily accessible to all players, you will instantly have all buyers min/maxing their costs, which gives the better crafters a massive advantage and monopoly over new crafters. The better crafters can always take a loss on making lower level items, materials etc, because they have already reached the apex and make good money on the higher ranked items.

      "body": ">The minute you make a list of all crafters on the server that is easily accessible to all players, you will instantly have all buyers min/maxing their costs, which gives the better crafters a massive advantage and monopoly over new crafter\n\nIt's not the same thing, currently we have limit per week. A crafter can only craft at most 4 public orders per week.\n\nWhat I'm proposing is a crafter can only post a limited amount of offerings at any given time. Those offerings cannot be removed from the market unless fulfilled for that week or a hefty price is paid, during weekly reset all existing offerings are removed.\n\nThat is it, a high end crafter would look to only post offerings that are most profitable to them, otherwise they'd lose money. This leaves a good chunk of the market for lower level crafters.\n\nAnyways, thanks for your input. I now regret that I've posted this because it clearly seems that I've been approaching the system in the wrong way. Apparently there's no flaws with the system it's just me not know how to work it out."

Completion rates, times, number of deaths, times when bosses are killed. How do you think they balance mobs, timers, and key timers?

      "body": ">How do you maximize the level of a crafted item?\n\nQuality is determined by your Skill in that craft, which is the sum of your profession level, tools, certain knowledge point nodes, and materials. You also have a chance for an \"inspired\" craft, which adds skill equal to a percentage of the base difficulty; think of it as a critical success.\n\nFor the Primal Molten Mace, you potentially have up to 100 points from profession level, 22 from tools, 150 from knowledge points (30 from Weaponsmithing, 30 from Hafted, 50 from Maces & Hammers, 40 from Hammer Control), and 75 from material quality (1/4 of base difficulty). An inspiration proc will add another 50 (1/6 of base difficulty), possibly more with knowledge points, Stable Fluidic Draconium, or the epic hammer. And you can use an Illustrious Insight for +30. That's up to 347 before inspiration or consumables. This particular item has base difficulty 300, +30 for the infusion, +15 for a Q3 missive, so if you're a completely maxed-out macesmith using all quality 3 mats, you can just barely guarantee max quality.\n\nFor a lot of items, and especially if you're not 100% maxed as a crafter, it can be easier to rely on recrafting to fish for inspiration procs, since this lets you get away with 50+ fewer points of skill and/or cheaper materials.\n\n>The meter on the side that shows a pipe | between two quality levels - is that a *chance* to get the right-side quality\n\nNo, it is just showing you how close your skill is to crafting the next level up. Unless you get an inspiration proc, you're getting the quality on the left, which is also the one shown on the tooltip."

Man this system needs a better tutorial. Thanks for explaining so well.\n\n  \nSo just to correctly summarize - I should MAX macesmithing, and X points in the other nodes (I don't have it in front of me but I can probably look at each 'spoke' of the node wheels you mentioned and look for +skill) and I'd need to get the epic hammer too, and use Q3 mats for the recraft. Okay at least I understand what I'm trying to do now.  \nis there better apron or toolbox I can get? should I swap out the toolbox for one with inspiration too (if one exists)?"

      "body": "There are blue tools for the two accessory slots; you can find them in the crafting order interface. They give +6 skill each in addition to having better stats than greens. Accessories have fixed stats, but you should probably get a hammer with inspiration (and the inspiration enchant) if you don't have it already.\n\nThe knowledge points here are mostly giving +skill as their core effect (the thing you get for each point in the node), rather than as spoke bonuses, although Hammer Control and Maces & Hammers do *also* have additional skill bonuses on top of that at certain spokes.\n\nYou should also invest in Poignant Plans, probably as a higher priority than any of the ones I just mentioned, which not only gives you an increase to your inspiration chance, but more importantly increases the skill bonus from inspiration by 50%. That would bring you up to 75 skill from inspiration, which is enough to make up for a LOT of missing specialization points, and it works on everything you craft instead of just maces."

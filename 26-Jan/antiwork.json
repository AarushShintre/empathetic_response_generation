FMLA can be paired with other benefits, including but not limited to: sick time, vacation time, PTO, and short term or long term disability leave. Not having access to the paid benefits (as in, if your PTO runs out) doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t still covered by FMLA. That\u2019s why you file for FMLA.\n\nFiling for FMLA is pretty minimal. It was a one sheet, front and back, piece of paper. I put my name, address, SS number on the front, and my doctor put my  requested accommodations on the back and signed it with her NPI. There was a spot for limitations in lieu of accommodations (like \u201ccan only lift 10 pounds\u201d). There was no need for a diagnosis of any kind. Just \u201cneeds 3 days off per month\u201d. \n\nIn contrast, when I went on disability leave that required constant paperwork.\n\nAt my current position, I have an accommodation for a max of 3 covered days off per month. I can choose to use my PTO, or choose to make up the time (as in work extra hours in the same pay period) or choose not to be paid."

It\u2019s legally required for your employer to pay into an unemployment fund for their employees, and if the employee gets laid off or can\u2019t work it\u2019s their right to claim it.\n\nIf a worker quits or is rightfully fired they are not eligible for unemployment at all.  You can\u2019t just work somewhere for a few months, quit and collect unemployment.\n\nEven if people did do this, they would be living in extreme poverty, why would anyone choose to live on unemployment when you can\u2019t even pay for food and rent with that little money.  $14/hr is nothing, it would be much more worth their time to look for a job that is at least $10/hr more than that.  My first job out of college 10 years ago was $30/hr, there is no way I would have taken a job for less than $25/hr.

Have you ever filed for unemployment?  Because you really don\u2019t seem to understand how it works at all.\n\nJust like with teachers who file for unemployment during the summer, it\u2019s their right to collect unemployment.  It\u2019s paid into the unemployment fund by your employer, it\u2019s literally the emplees money to collect when the situation calls for it.  It\u2019s not abusing the system at all, it\u2019s just the way the system works.\n\nWhat is your problem with people collecting unemployment?  It hardly pays anything at all anyway.  If someone who works long enough to be eligible for it, then the employer pays into that fund for them to take it.

It\u2019s not taking anyone\u2019s taxes away, it\u2019s not making anything more expensive, it\u2019s just collecting money that is rightfully yours.\n\nYou know who abuses the system the most?  Walmart.  The first thing they teach you when you get a job at Walmart is how to apply for food stamps.  That way the government can subsidize the pay that their employers get so that they don\u2019t have to pay them enough to pay for their own food.

Regarding showering, you can do that at the marina or a gym which was my go-to, or in a pinch, you could do rain, hang a solar shower, whatever. You make due. \n\nAs far as electrics, I added solar panels, a wind generator, and extra house batteries, coupled with an inverter worked fine for a lot of the power tools that I needed, I also had a honda e2000 if I was getting low and not enough sun or wind to top off. I'd make stuff on shore and throw it in the dinghy or bring the boat to a transient dock for the galley, and the bigger things.\n\nWhen I had to redo my rigging and step the mast, I was back at a dock. When I had to repaint the hull, replace the prop, the rudder, replace transducers and add additional thru-holes, I hauled out. \n\nReplacing the engine didn't require a haul-out or dry docking. It had a Volvo MD11 engine that weighed a little under 500 pounds. I pulled up to a slip and built a derrick to lift the engine off the mounts and to a place where I could use the main halyard and a derrick in the cockpit to bring it out. It's not a big engine. I dropped a beta 38, which was lighter, with a few adapter plates, and adjusted the drive shaft. It took me about five days in total, but most of that was taking it apart, cleaning, and putting all the cables and shit back together. \n\nBy the way, you can't use a USDA loan to buy land for a mobile home. You could use it for a premanufactured home, but not a mobile one. You also have to live in an area with less than 35,000 people."

You played dirty with that Volvo\u2026 that\u2019s some darn stranger danger trying a self pull, have seen it go bad many a time. Was it fully seized or blow by? (We will not talk about how you dumped the head.) I was brought up in one of the largest sailing towns in southern US. Have worked fiberglass since before I was a teenager. But those skills are the same as any others, you learn them (as you learned how to invert power from a trickle charger) because you HAVE TO cutting down trees is easy, not getting hit by said trees is a bit harder, pulling up the roots takes some time to learn. But if you learned how to take down a Volvo diesel then why are we fucking arguing? You understand what I am saying\u2026 necessity dictates what you do. And yea, get the trailer included in the USDA loan not just the land (there is a part for that, remember these loans are built for farmers and farm land\u2026 they prepared for dipshits like me)\n\nSorry edit: pre manufactured here in NC means that they have taken the wheels off and put underpinning on."

And now fast forward with the pandemic inflation the market is showing signs of correcting itself and instead of letting the market correct, they're increasing interests to curb labor prices. Apparently labor prices are causing inflation. We're asking for too much money inspite of the fact that the amount of money we're asking for doesn't even match inflation. Pre and post pandemic. All these labor strikes and it being an employee's market. Instead of am employers market. They wanna crush labor instead of letting the market correct.\n\nNot only that if you dig into Urbanism/ Strong Towns you'll be opened up to a whole can of fuckery you probably didn't even know existed or kinda knew but didn't have the language to express.\n\nYou're right.

      "body": "I have listed 6 items including boots. First item is mythic. Second item is **either** Shadowflame *or* Seraph's, depending on champion. Boots is a third slot. Slots four, five and six are made up of three items. Zhonya's, Rabadon's and Void Staff. That's six items, not three. These are the same every game. Building Zhonya's before Rabadon's one game and building Rabadon's before Zhonya's the next does not make them two separate builds. It's the same build. \n\nI also feel the need to point out, once again, that you generally don't have a choice on second item. Orianna is going to get Seraph's because her mana costs are terrible. Ahri is always going to get Shadowflame to be able to do her job. Malzahar is going to get Rylai's. You're not choosing here.\n\nAlso no, Demonic and Morello are not choices for third item. Buying one of those means not buying one of Void Staff, Zhonya's and Rabadon's. Demonic *specifically* is an option for Malzahar *specifically* but don't act like that means mage items have variety. If anything that means Malzahar has slightly more variety than all of the other mages. He's not exactly representative of the mage playstyle in League anyway.  \nBuying one of those items on any other champ means that you either choose to deal no damage or you invite the enemy assassin, fighter, or even tank at this point to come and bend you over with nothing you can do about it. CC them on the way in? *laughs in tenacity*\n\nI just checked four different mages that fulfill different-ish subroles and they all have the same items listed as fourth, fifth and sixth item options on [u.gg](https://u.gg). Syndra, Viktor, Orianna and Ahri ALL have Rabadon's, Zhonya's and Void Staff as their three final item choices. And before you get on me about how Syndra and Ahri have Banshee's and Morello, respectively, listed as a sixth item option it's worth noting that they're way less commonly built AND probably the wrong choice in many cases. Checking those four champions on Lolalytics confirms the same thing. Final three items are Zhonya's, Void Staff, Rabadon's. Shocker.\n\nRegarding Morello vs Shadowflame you're right. It's not technically strictly worse. You get 100 extra hp you don't want on Morello instead of a useful stat. I was thinking of the version coming next patch which gives the same stats as Shadowflame, but lesser or equal amounts across the board. And like I previously mentioned, you're giving up your damage or your one hope for survival to get healing cut which literally every other teammate is better suited to pick up. Mages are not supposed to run around 1v1-ing fighters anyway, so not always being near your support is irrelevant. When healing cut matters you will be near your support.\n\nNearly all mages have one build. Changing the order of the final three items you build is not variety. It's still the same build. Like you said you don't even always get to make that choice. Games can end way before then."

To say that these are \"the same every game\" is just exceptionally wrong.\n\nYeah, you do. Ori *can* skip Seraphs, and especially after these changes, its just *usually* her best item, but every champ has one of those. Ahri has a couple alternatives. Or lets go by most popular mages. Viktor for example can pick Seraphs, Shadowflame, Zhonyas or Lich Bane as his second item. Shadowflame is the generically best one, but all 4 choices are *totally* valid. You are in fact choosing here.\n\nYeah they are. Yes, it does mean that. Again, most champs ***DONT ALWAYS GET ALL 3 OF THOSE***. No champ has 100% on all by item 5, in fact its rare for any of these to exceed 70% cumulatively. \n\nAnd if we dont narrow it down to just third item, its also an option on Swain. And Anivia. And Vlad. And Cass. And keep in mind, the item is currently ***BAD***. If it wasnt bad, more people would pick it. In fact, more people did pick it before Riot randomly nerfed it. \n\nLmao you just cant actually read the item page, can you? Syndra is usually rabadons, void staff, zhonyas, yes. Except Banshees can replace Zhonyas. Shadowflame also can be the third item if you go seraphs. Oriannas third item is ***SHADOWFLAME***, followed by Rabadons and Void Staff. Zhonyas isnt even in her most common build. In the case of Ahri, Rabadons is often not in her final build, as Morello Banshees and Cosmic Drive all compete with it. And finally for Viktor, Zhonyas is often not in his final build, as it competes with banshees, lich ban, Morello and in case of the Seraph build Shadowflame. \n\nWow whats this? All these champs have variety? And they only loosely share that variety with each other? Shocker.\n\n... oh you dont actually have a clue about the items youre talking about, do you. Lets ignore how many mages actually do in fact want hp, you do remember the gold difference? The one that matters a lot and means Morellos spikes earlier? Why do you think the item is picked occasionalyl in pro play? This is why.\n\nNo, they dont. Look, you clearly dont really understand itemisation, so lets do learning by seeing, yes? [This](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/LPL/2023_Season/Spring_Season/Scoreboards) is the scoreboards of the current LPL season. These are arguably the best players in the game, all on mages. Look at their builds. Do they all look like one build to you? No, not even close. Even if you exclude Ryze because he is weird, there is variety in mythics and legendaries. Great amount of it too. Assassins meanwhile? Nah, not even close."

      "body": "Let's not act like pros always build correctly. Remember Deft 40% crit Infinity Edge? I heard that guy is pretty good so surely that must be the correct build. What's that? IE doesn't work until 60% crit? Well, Deft is a pro so he must have seen the future and thought he was playing on 13.2 years in advance I guess. Pros not building correctly is famously widespread in League.\n\nI'll still humor you though. Sylas, Galio, Akali and Kassadin are not mages, so we'll discount them. Ryze too I guess. What's left? Mythic, Boots, Rabadon's, Zhonya's, Void Staff. Overwhelmingly represented. Deviations from those items are Yagao building Horizon Focus twice, Banshee's once, and Shanks building Banshee's once. One player is responsible for three of the four TOTAL items that are not the ones I've listed as the items you can build. Yagao could be misinformed or a Genja-esque timelord, but to me it looks like LPL pros agree that you build the same items nearly every game. Checked week 2 and Yagao is responsible for the only deviation here. He built Nashor's on Azir one game. That's as niche as it gets. Thank you for proving my point, I guess?\n\nYou brought up Syndra and me not being able to read the item page, apparently (weird since I specifically mentioned Banshee's making an appearance for Syndra in my comment but I guess neither of us can read), but yeah we can play that game. Talon has Black Cleaver and Guardian Angel listed as options. You didn't mention any of those as buildable items. Zed has Serylda's popping up as fourth or fifth or sixth item, that alone is three builds, right? Isn't this how it works? Qiyana buys Death's Dance and Manamune. You didn't mention those items. Death's dance appears in two slots, by the way, so that's at least two more builds right there.\n\nMoving on to Lolalytics a quick check here tells me Talon can build Prowler's Claw, Ravenous Hydra, Ghostblade, Goredrinker (higher winrate than Prowler's Claw, guess you have some variety in assassin mythics too!), Eclipse and Duskblade. All of them above 50% winrate. All *valid* choices, right?"

      "body": "Always, perhaps not. Almost always however? Yeah, they do. Especially when theyve got coaches behind them. \n\nWell sure, if we wanna exclude Galio (we shouldnt, he is basically a melee mage), then we can make it look less variable. But lets ***ACTUALLY*** see whats going on here. First, great variety of mythics. Were only missing Liandrys from the commonly picked mythics, but the champs that pro focuses on just dont use it. So 3-4 mythics. Already good. Now, Legendaries. Zhonyas is very common. Shadowflame is too. Rabadons was only built by Syndras (and non-mages), and only 3/6 times, so hardly \"overwhelmingly represented\". Now we also have Banshees, Horizon, and Seraphs. And if we dont exclude Ryze, we also get Morello, which leaves us at 7 different variations of legendary items bought. However more importantly is the builds we have. How many of them are overlapping? Not a lot. Yagaos Ahri build shares only Void Staff with Harders Syndra build. And Harders Syndra build shares *nothing* with Yagaos Taliyah build. Meanwhile you would fail to find any assassin builds that dont share 3 items with each other. Now lets throw in the [LCK](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/LCK/2023_Season/Spring_Season/Scoreboards) and we also get Morellos, and your \"Oh its just Yagao\" thing falls apart because their Ahri pulled the same HF build.\n\nThe main point was that on Ori, Zhonyas is not part of her standard build (which it isnt). As for your examples, Talon does have a choice there, I suppose. He just has no choice prior, since Hydra is not an option. In the case of Zed, thats a difference between Zed with Hydra and Zed without Hydra. Which is already the one choice I mentioned. Qiyana also gets a choice, but loses the Hyra choice. So congrats, you found examples of all assassins ... having one choice. Just not every time the Hydra one (and I admit, I missed Qiyana, mostly because she is so bad I dont think about her tbh).\n\nFirst of all, Lolalytics is far less accurate. Second of all, no you dont. Of these, Ghostblade is not a choice, its an order thing (Prowlers into Ghostblade or Ghostblade into Prowlers. Same build, different order). Hydra isnt good, thats why its never picked. Goredrinker isnt good, thats why its never picked (item winrate is super worthless as a metric, even moreso than winrate in general), and Eclipse and Duskblade are also worthless, hence never picked. Your choice is Prowlers ... or Prowlers."

      "body": "How is it possible that the same assassin items built in different orders are the same build when the same mage items built in different orders are different builds? Wasn't an order thing a few comments ago. You seemed to be of the opinion that Luden's -> Sorcs -> Shadowflame -> Rabadon's -> Zhonya's -> Void Staff would be a different build to Luden's -> Sorcs - > Shadowflame -> Zhonya's -> Void Staff -> Rabadon's. Is that still the case? If so, Prowler's into Ghostblade or Ghostblade into Prowler's would have to be two different builds too, no? Can't have it both ways.\n\nLmao at Galio is basically a mage. You're funny. Mages famously dash into melee range and have taunts. Galio is an AP tank or fighter at best. Mage? Not even close.\n\nYeah the LPL builds differ a bit. Harder built Luden's -> Shadowflame -> Void Staff -> working on Rabadon's, while Shanks built \\*checks notes\\* Luden's -> Shadowflame -> Void Staff -> Rabadon. Before you say \"uh but look look he has Banshee's\" that's a substitution you could make for Zhonyas specifically vs multiple AP threats, and that's rare. If enemy comp didn't include Gwen, Akali and Heimer that's not a Banshee's.\n\nAnd what's this about different champs not sharing items? You're telling me the mana-hungry sustained damage mage wants a different mythic and first legendary than the burst oriented assassin-esque mage? By your own admission assassin builds don't fully share items. Does this imply they have variety in their builds? Compare LPL and LCK Ahri builds. Looks like they are the same. Specifically for Ahri you can replace Shadowflame/Seraph's with Horizon Focus. Every build Ahri build looks like this: Everfrost -> Horizon Focus -> Zhonyas/Void Staff. Variety btw.\n\nYou bring up LCK. W1D1 and W1D2 have no Morello's anywhere on a mage. What I do see however is nearly every single mage build looking like this: Mythic -> Shadowflame/Seraph's -> Zhonya's/Rabadon's/Void Staff in any order. Curious. Like I previously mentioned, Ahri deviates slightly with a more rigid second item. So less variety for her than the champs who have built both Shadowflame and Seraph's.\n\nMoving on to W1D3 and W1D4. Some hints of Morello here, I'll grant you that. Two games. Azir with a completed Morello in HLE vs. Liiv G3 and Syndra with an Oblivion Orb in NS vs. KT G3. Funny how both lost. Apart from that? Mythic -> Shadowflame/Seraph's -> Rabadon's/Zhonya's/Void Staff. Hmm. \n\nAs far as I can tell pros agree with me. When you're playing a mage you build the following every game:\n\nMythic -> Seraph's/Shadowflame (Horizon Focus specifically on Ahri) -> Zhonyas/Rabadon's/Void Staff. That's it. That's the build."

No, I said that if you replace Zhonyas with Void staff, that *is* a different build, whereas you argued that isnt.\n\nLissandra famously dashes in melee range and has a root. Is she not a mage? Turns out, the range is not what a mage makes. Galio is not a tank, nor a fighter. He is built too squishy for that. He however isnt an assassin either, since he doesnt burst people down. Mage is the closest to a good classification we have.\n\nOh so two players on the same champ had the same build, ergo no build variety? Now, how do Ucals and Scouts build fit into that? Still Syndra, but, *gasp* different builds. Liandrys on both, and Zhonyas on ucal. How about Tangyuan going Morellos? Or Xiahou going crown? Or in the LCK Showmaker going Seraphs? Thats *3* mythics on the same champ, and a total of 7 legendaries built, in just two weeks. That sure sounds like a *lot* of variety to me. I mean imagine complaining that you can only pick from 3 mythics. Assassins even *technically* only have 3, and practically have 1.\n\n... you are aware both Syndra and Ahri are burst-mages, right? And hell, Syndras dont even share their full build between each other. And no, assassin builds almost entirely do. Hydra or no hydra and maybe the last item, thats about it. Otherwise every single AD Assassin, no matter what, is on Prowlers exactly, Ghostblade, Serylda. Meanwhile not even every Syndra is on the same 3 first items, let alone every mage. And you have an interesting definition of \"exactly the same\" if oyu think Ahris are exactly the same. Apparently Everfrost, HF, Banshees, and building either Raba or Shadowflame is the same as Everfrost, HF, Zhonyas and Void staff. Whats that? 2 items are different? Thats actual variety? Yeah.\n\nIgnoring that you are once again condensing like 6 builds into one, thats hilariously not even correct. Its not just Ahri that deviates (And not slightly), you also forgot Lissandra going neither Seraphs nor Shadowflame, the Karma mid, Two Azirs going neither of your second items, the Morello Azirs, the Syndra going shadowflame and Seraphs, yeah, you missed a lot. Certainly ***VERY*** far from \"Mythic -> Shadowflame/Seraph's -> Rabadon's/Zhonya's/Void Staff\". Which again, is still 6 builds youre condensing into one. \n\nYeah except for the many, *many* examples of pros not doing that. Or the fact that you say \"mythic\" to hide the fact that you can choose between 3+ mythics on several mages, a luxury assassins for example dont have. Or the fact that youre condensing multiple builds into one. But at this point its clear youre either arguing in bad faith, or just really struggling to understand what a build is. I can lead you to variety, but I cant force you to see."

You are not talking about avid readers you are talking about a very specific type of person. And personally I think using the term average well read makes absolutely no sense when describing this kind of person. It's an oxymoron. They are far from average with the level you consider well read. Most people would consider average well read as anyone that just reads a decent amount.\n\nI'm native English speaker and I read a lot. I consider my vocab to be fairly large and I've never come across that word before. A lot of words are totally useless and can be replaced with simpler more common phrases. It's very common to learn new words constantly."

You can say the average challenger player gets 8 cs/m even though there are very few challenger players. Or that the average billionaire can afford a yacht. Of course I don't mean the literal average in a math sense, what I mean is more like the median or mode. I mean if you picture a well-read person in your head, or to say it pretentiously, if you imagine the Platonic form of a well-read person, they know the word anathema.\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure more than 0.001% of native English speakers read literary fiction... anecdotally I work at a restaurant, which is to say it's not like a university or whatever, and the majority of my coworkers do. My parents do and some of my friends do. Again, anathema is not some word James Joyce made up, it comes up a fair amount and you don't have to be a professor of literature to have encountered it. \n\nRegardless, the real oxymoron is calling yourself well-read while not reading any literature. That's like saying you're a mathematician even though you never got past algebra. So no matter how avid of a reader you are, if your avidity is limited to YA books and League lore you are not gonna be considered well-read, sorry."

I am just a normal socially upper-middle class American with a college degree and so are most of my acquaintances. And you can see [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anathema) that random newspapers like \"Dallas News\" read by other normal Americans use this word. But no, it's not common and it's perfectly reasonable if you've read a bunch of books or whatever and never encountered it, just a little surprising to me.\n\nIt's just that to me well-read means that someone is specifically notable for how much they've read. It's a way higher bar to clear, it's not even like I'm saying the average smart person knows the word anathema, we're talking about word specialists here. It's like if someone was a history buff and they said they had never heard of the \"East India Company.\" That would just be surprising to me, if you're into history I'd expect you to know a lot of somewhat famous historical stuff.

Yes doing something like an effective gank at early levels in pro defines whether someone can win the lane or not, minor disadvantages build up and are punished heavily. If Perkz doesn't int every enemy roam timer that lane is rly bad for Syndra.\n\nAnd new Ezreal build 100% outscales Varus. And I was referring to the poke in lane with W-Q and E, not the poke later... obviously Varus doesn't poke late-game without some version of lethality build. And not having to interact\u2260even lane, Varus can still deny CS, get plates, set up bad lane states by being stronger early. Only in low elo can you say \"lol just farm with Ez Q it's easy lane,\" Ez might be safer than other ADCs but AFK Q farming Ez is still punishable in other ways. For example, Varus naturally gets prio on Ezreal to set up drakes, but a gank w/ gold advantage and burned summs can allow Ezreal to play up and contest wave to contest drag setup, wonder in what sort of a game that would be relevant...?"

I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and wasting your time, please believe whatever you wish about the game.\n\nFF I meant Syndra w/e. Syndra still supposed to bully Ryze early, and Syndra flash is even more important than Azir flash as she\u2019s completely immobile. Yes they traded flashes but that\u2019s a good trade for Ryze, especially the damage followup and zoning when wave is frozen at Ryze turret.\n\nVarus 100% pokes in lane with any build, that\u2019s just how the champion works LMAO. Tell me you haven\u2019t laned against Varus without telling me you haven\u2019t laned against Varus. His E and Q have very high base damages at early levels. There\u2019s a reason a lot of people just go comet, even when they don\u2019t plan on going a poke build - the champion just inherently has strong long ranged harass.\n\nHow to punish Ezreal? Pretty much the same as most ADCs, he\u2019s LESS punishing but you can still do denials. Getting any slowpush makes it impossible for Ezreal to ever fight into (just sit behind minions), meaning you can easily get good trades, harass, and block Q\u2019s to deny CS. Get some harass down on the slowpush and you can threaten dive or harass more under turret (again, he can\u2019t trade back into a wave). With better push you can always threaten a freeze, which Ez can handle better than other ADCs but can never break without jungle assistance. Basically, if Ez can only farm with Q the whole lane and you\u2019re playing up as you should, he will lose CS. But you\u2019re missing the forest for the trees, it\u2019s not mainly about the CS leads, but the plates and lack of wave control (either setting up dives through uncontested slowpushes or ganks through uncontested freezes) that let good Varus\u2019 get large advantages. Getting such an early kill in an awful wavestate while burning summs makes it infinitely more difficult for Varus to hit his wincons in early game.\n\nIf you can\u2019t tell why Perkz\u2019 ints are ints, and why Bo\u2019s plays are good plays then you\u2019re just not very good lmao. All plays require mistakes and punishes. The distinction between someone inting, and someone else making a good play, is how expected the play is and the difficulty of the punish. A toplaner dying to a \u201cunexpected\u201d 3-15-3:30 gank from enemy jg fullclear/5-camp is inting, even if the gank is performed perfectly - a midlaner dying to a level 2 gank from a non-Kayn enemy jg that took enemy raptors and flashed from behind is just a good play from that jungler. Perkz dying to a 3-man while flashless, on the most obvious support roam timer ever (off base going mid), after enemy jg has massive tempo lead and hasn\u2019t been spotted in a while, and with wave pushing into him close to turret (ie literally no reason to walk up whatsoever) is INTING. The setup from FNC was perfect, the execution was clean, but it was also incredibly by the books and expected! Perkz should never die there and his team shouldn\u2019t need to cover. And almost all Perkz\u2019 deaths were similar clear overextensions. Bo level 2 ganking bot with GRAVES, into 3-camping into another gank mid (3-camp gank mid is standard, but not after you\u2019ve griefed your tempo by like 20 seconds on a farming jungler by ganking bot level 2), cleanly executing both, is NOT standard. Yes enemies made mistakes but are they really supposed to expect Graves, the champion known for fullclearing and invading, to forsake both those wincons entirely to gank their lane (which in most cases is not easily punishable level 1). Bo\u2019s turret dive on the Perkz death countergank was similarly very aggressive and unexpected. FNC appears to be completely out after the gank, but Bo calls to keep going, dashing in 1v3 to smokescreen under turret  so that Kaiser can flash in under turret 1v3 to 2 full health enemies with full cooldowns, so that PHOTON can also flash in 1v3 (after Kaiser pulls back from turret) under turret to barely finish the kill. It\u2019s an insanely aggressive call to make and once again no other jungler would go for this. Like I don\u2019t see how you could ever look at this game and think anything other than \u201cthe whole of VIT, especially Bo in the early game, are making great unorthodox plays to get advantages, but Perkz keeps inting to pull them down.\u201d"

Btw pyosik looked impressive the 2nd time around against rogue. \n\nAlso Pyosik isn\u2019t a lower tier eastern player. He was a streaky player that wasn\u2019t good enough for the absolute top teams, he is still fucking better than all of lcs. Pyosik was gapping canyon and just won worlds. The fuck are you on about."

Being streaky means you're playing really well for a while then play really poorly for a while(aka streaks of good/bad play).

He was by far the weakest link of DRX. Any other jungler in the top 4 would've been more impactful on that team.

The previous system let you still be a viable smite threat even if you\u2019re down in camps and levels, this new one is dependent on how many camps you\u2019ve killed, so the team who is ahead can easily deny camps and keep the enemy jungler at a lower smite for longer (which was the whole issue with the level based smite dmg system, this new one is just a less extreme version of it)."

If we're talking basics\n\nthe only thing aram can realistically help you with is teamfighting but even then it's not ideal because aram has much faster spikes so you're playing with more power than you would have in a normal game. op clearly wants to get better at the game and sr is the best way to do that. \n\nanyway it doesn't matter i guess, since op seems to have already gotten a boost? or sold his account lmao."

ARAM allows you to develop that very basic piece of knowledge in a compact and dense fashion. \n\nIt's also 30 straight minutes of practice piloting your character. Which again, no bronze 4 player is doing even remotely well. \n\nAnd it's entertaining and action packed, meaning they're 10x more likely to stay engaged with the content than with SR, which can easily lead to autopilot issues, and not absorbing anything.

ARAM is not going to make you worse at SR. It's straight up nonsensical.\n\nI'm not going to suggest to anyone taking rank seriously to ARAM for training. But new players, and players who are literally iron 4 and therefore probably worse than the majority of fresh level 30s, I totally will. Because they very very very likely still struggle with basic mechanical functions of the game. And basic champion knowledge. \n\nAnd outside of treating the game like a school assignment, ARAM is one of the better outlets for getting as much champion interaction in as possible per minute spent, while also staying entertaining."
